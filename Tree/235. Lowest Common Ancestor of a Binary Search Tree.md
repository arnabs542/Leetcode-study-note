## Keyword
LCA, BST

## Problem description
```
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Given binary search tree:  root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]

Example 1:

Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
Example 2:

Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
 

Note:

All of the nodes' values will be unique.
p and q are different and both values will exist in the BST.

## 2/14/2020 Recursion

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        //create variable for easy comparison
        int rVal = root.val, pVal = p.val, qVal = q.val;
        //the LCA is either in the left branch or right branch or the node itself
        if(rVal > pVal && rVal > qVal) return lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
        if(rVal < pVal && rVal < qVal) return lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
        return root;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Recursion\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Use recursion to perform a search utilizing BST's properties. Whenever the two target nodes' values don't fall into the range of bigger than or smaller than node value together, the node is the LCA.

iteration\
Time complexity: O(n) \
Space complexity: O(1) no extra space used
## Notes
This easy iteration is made possible without use of stack because of BST's properties
