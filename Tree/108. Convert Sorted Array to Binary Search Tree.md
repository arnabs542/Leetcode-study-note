## Keyword
BST

## Problem description
```
Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Example:

Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5
```

class Solution {
    public TreeNode sortedArrayToBST(int[] nums) {
        return helper(nums, 0, nums.length);
    }
    private TreeNode helper(int[] nums, int l, int r){
        //when the array cannot be divided anymore
        if (l >= r) {return null;}
        //split the range
        int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
        TreeNode cur = new TreeNode(nums[m]);
        cur.left = helper(nums, l, m);
        cur.right = helper(nums, m + 1, r);
        return cur;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Recursion\
Time complexity: O(n) \
Space complexity: O(logn) stack calls and O(n) to keep all the output nodes

## Notes
Use recursion and a Pre-order DFS to construct the BST. Note that there are multiple solutions when the number of elements dont build a full BST. We can adjust the answer by moving the root node to the right side, or leftside, or even random side of the middle point when building the BST. Also, note that we are using [l, r) range when calling recursion.
