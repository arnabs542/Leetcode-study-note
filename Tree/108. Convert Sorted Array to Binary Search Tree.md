## Keyword
Tree

## Problem description
```
Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Example:

Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5
```

/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.

 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }

 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode sortedArrayToBST(int[] nums) {
        return helper(nums, 0, nums.length - 1);
    }
    TreeNode helper(int[] nums, int l, int r){
        if(l < r){
            int mid = (l + r) / 2;
            TreeNode root = new TreeNode(nums[mid]);
            root.left = helper(nums, l, mid);
            root.right = helper(nums, mid + 1, r);
            return root;
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Recursion(DFS)\
Time complexity: O(n) \
Space complexity: O(logn) stack calls and O(n) to keep all the output nodes

## Notes
Use recursion and a Pre-order DFS to construct the BST. Note that there are multiple solutions when the number of elements dont build a full BST. We can adjust the answer by moving the root node to the right side, or leftside, or even random side of the middle point when building the BST.
