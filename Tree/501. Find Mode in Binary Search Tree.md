## Keyword
BST

## Problem description
```
Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, find all the mode(s) (the most frequently occurred element) in the given BST.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 

For example:
Given BST [1,null,2,2],

   1
    \
     2
    /
   2
 

return [2].

Note: If a tree has more than one mode, you can return them in any order.

Follow up: Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).

```java
/**

class Solution {
    List<Integer> ans;
    Integer last = null;
    int count = 1;
    int maxCount = 0;
    public int[] findMode(TreeNode root) {
        ans = new ArrayList<>();
        //count for the highest frequency
        countForFrequency(root);
        return ans.stream().mapToInt(i -> i).toArray();
    }
    private void countForFrequency(TreeNode root){
        //if the node is empty
        if (root == null) {return;}
        //inorder traversal
        countForFrequency(root.left);
        //update max frequency
        if (last != null){
            if (last == root.val){
                count++;
            }
            else{
                count = 1;
            }
        }
        //update answer list
        //if a new value is more frequent, clear the current list
        if (count > maxCount){
            ans.clear();
            ans.add(root.val);
        }
        //if a new value is as frequent as the most frequent node, add it in
        if( count == maxCount){
            ans.add(root.val);
        }
        maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, count);
        last = new Integer(root.val);
        countForFrequency(root.right);
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Recursion\
Time complexity: O(n) \
Space complexity: O(H) 

## Notes
Use recursion to do inorder traversal. We keep global variables to remember the highest frequency so far and the frequency of the last visited node. Note that we need to clear the existing answer list if a new node is more frequent than the highest frequency so far.
