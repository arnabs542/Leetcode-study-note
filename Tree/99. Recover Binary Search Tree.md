https://leetcode.com/problems/recover-binary-search-tree/

## Keyword
Tree, BST, Inorder traversal

## Problem description
```
Two elements of a binary search tree (BST) are swapped by mistake.

Recover the tree without changing its structure.

Example 1:

Input: [1,3,null,null,2]

   1
  /
 3
  \
   2

Output: [3,1,null,null,2]

Example 2:

Input: [3,1,4,null,null,2]

  3
 / \
1   4
   /
  2

Output: [2,1,4,null,null,3]

A solution using O(n) space is pretty straight forward.
Could you devise a constant space solution?

## 3/27/2020 DFS recursion

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    int count = 0;
    TreeNode[] list = new TreeNode[2];
    //record the previous node and its parent in Inorder traversal
    TreeNode previous = null;
    public void recoverTree(TreeNode root) {
        //DFS to find out the two nodes
        helper(root);
        //swap misplaced nodes back
        swap(list[0], list[1]);
    }
    private void helper(TreeNode cur){
        //base case
        if(cur == null) return;
        //compute predecessor
        helper(cur.left);
        

        if(previous != null){
            //check if the current node is out of place
            if(cur.val < previous.val){
                if(count == 0){
                    list[count++] = previous;
                    list[count] = cur;
                }
                else list[count] = cur;
            } 
        }
        //update previous node
        previous = cur;
        
        //compute succesor
        helper(cur.right);
    }
    private void swap(TreeNode x, TreeNode y){
        int temp;
        temp = x.val;
        x.val = y.val;
        y.val = temp;
    }
}
```

Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
To find out misplaced nodes together in Inorder traversal order, we can use recursion method and use a global pointer to keep track of the current previous node. Note that we only need to swap two nodes' values, not the nodes themselves. Also note that there are 3 cases: 1. two misplaced nodes are next to each other; 2. two misplaced nodes are away from each other, we encounter the first node that is bigger than its succesor; 3. two misplaced nodes are away from each other, we encounter the second node that is smaller than its previous node
