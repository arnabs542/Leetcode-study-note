https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-difference-between-node-and-ancestor/

## Keyword
Tree, DFS

## Problem description
```
Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum value V for which there exists different nodes A and B where V = |A.val - B.val| and A is an ancestor of B.

(A node A is an ancestor of B if either: any child of A is equal to B, or any child of A is an ancestor of B.)

 

Example 1:



Input: [8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]
Output: 7
Explanation: 
We have various ancestor-node differences, some of which are given below :
|8 - 3| = 5
|3 - 7| = 4
|8 - 1| = 7
|10 - 13| = 3
Among all possible differences, the maximum value of 7 is obtained by |8 - 1| = 7.
 

Note:

The number of nodes in the tree is between 2 and 5000.
Each node will have value between 0 and 100000.

        return diff;
    }
	private void helper(TreeNode root, int min, int max) {
        //if we finished traversing a branch, we try to update the global diff variable
		if (root == null) {
			diff = Math.max(diff, max - min);
            return;
		}
        //update min max value on the branch
		min = Math.min(min, root.val);
        max = Math.max(max, root.val);
        //pass the min max to children
        helper(root.left, min, max);
        helper(root.right, min, max);
	}
}

Time complexity: O(n) \
Space complexity: O(h)

## Notes
Use dfs to traverse the tree. Pass the current min max of the branch down until the end is reached.
