## Keyword
BST

## Problem description
```
Given the root node of a binary search tree (BST) and a value to be inserted into the tree, insert the value into the BST. Return the root node of the BST after the insertion. It is guaranteed that the new value does not exist in the original BST.

Note that there may exist multiple valid ways for the insertion, as long as the tree remains a BST after insertion. You can return any of them.

For example, 

Given the tree:
        4
       / \
      2   7
     / \
    1   3
And the value to insert: 5
You can return this binary search tree:

         4
       /   \
      2     7
     / \   /
    1   3 5
This tree is also valid:

         5
       /   \
      2     7
     / \   
    1   3
         \
          4
```

        while (cur != null){
            // insert the node to the right subtree
            if (cur.val < val){
                if (cur.right != null) {cur = cur.right;}
                else {
                    cur.right = new TreeNode(val);
                    return root;
                }
            }
            // insert the node to the left subtree
            else {
                if (cur.left != null) {cur = cur.left;}
                else {
                    cur.left = new TreeNode(val);
                    return root;
                }
            }
        }
        //if the tree is empty
        return new TreeNode(val);
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
iteration\
Time complexity: O(H)
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Based on BST's property, we can percolate down the tree and tree to insert the node whereever there's an open space.

}
```

## Complexity Analyze
recursion\
Time complexity: O(H)
Space complexity: O(H)

## Notes
The recursion solution use the same idea. Note that for each recursion call, we always return the current node, and try to reconnect current node's children to the result of recursion call on subtrees. This ensures that the tree structure will not change except at the insert point.
