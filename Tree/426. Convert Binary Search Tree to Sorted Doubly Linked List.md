## Problem description
```
Convert a Binary Search Tree to a sorted Circular Doubly-Linked List in place.

You can think of the left and right pointers as synonymous to the predecessor and successor pointers in a doubly-linked list. For a circular doubly linked list, the predecessor of the first element is the last element, and the successor of the last element is the first element.

We want to do the transformation in place. After the transformation, the left pointer of the tree node should point to its predecessor, and the right pointer should point to its successor. You should return the pointer to the smallest element of the linked list.

 

Example 1:



Input: root = [4,2,5,1,3]


Output: [1,2,3,4,5]

Explanation: The figure below shows the transformed BST. The solid line indicates the successor relationship, while the dashed line means the predecessor relationship.

Example 2:

Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
Example 3:

Input: root = []
Output: []
Explanation: Input is an empty tree. Output is also an empty Linked List.
Example 4:

Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
 

Constraints:

-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
Node.left.val < Node.val < Node.right.val
All values of Node.val are unique.
0 <= Number of Nodes <= 2000

## 3/27/2020 DFS recursion

```java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node left;
    public Node right;

    public Node() {}

    public Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
    }

    public Node(int _val,Node _left,Node _right) {
        val = _val;
        left = _left;
        right = _right;
    }
};
*/
class Solution {
    public Node treeToDoublyList(Node root) {
        //corner case
        if(root == null) return null;
        Node head = new Node();
        Node tail = helper(head, root);
        //connect head and tail
        head.right.left = tail;
        tail.right = head.right;
        return head.right;
    }
    private Node helper(Node parent, Node current){
        //base case, skip empty node, use current parent as previous stack's parent
        if(current == null) return parent;
        //use the current parent as left traversal's parent
        Node left = helper(parent, current.left);
        //use left subtree's last node as current node's parent
        current.left = left;
        left.right = current;
        //use current node as right traversal's parent
        Node right = helper(current, current.right);
        //return the right most node for previous stack
        return right;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
DFS\
Time complexity: O(n) \
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
To connect all nodes together in Inorder traversal order, we can use recursion method that takes previous tail as parameter and returns its own tail for the next function call. Note that we need to use a dummy head node to start the entire process.

## 3/27/2020 Community Concise recursion

```java
class Solution {
  // the smallest (first) and the largest (last) nodes
  Node first = null;
  Node last = null;

  public void helper(Node node) {
    if (node != null) {
      // left
      helper(node.left);
      // node 
      if (last != null) {
        // link the previous node (last)
        // with the current one (node)
        last.right = node;
        node.left = last;
      }
      else {
        // keep the smallest node
        // to close DLL later on
        first = node;
      }
      last = node;
      // right
      helper(node.right);
    }
  }

  public Node treeToDoublyList(Node root) {
    if (root == null) return null;

    helper(root);
    // close DLL
    last.right = first;
    first.left = last;
    return first;
  }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
DFS\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
A more concise recursion solution. We use a global pointer to keep track of the current head and tail.
