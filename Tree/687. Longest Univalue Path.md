## Keyword
Tree, recursion, contribution

## Problem description
```
Given a binary tree, find the length of the longest path where each node in the path has the same value. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

 

Example 1:

Input:

              5
             / \
            4   5
           / \   \
          1   1   5
Output: 2

 

Example 2:

Input:

              1
             / \
            4   5
           / \   \
          4   4   5
Output: 2

 

Note: The given binary tree has not more than 10000 nodes. The height of the tree is not more than 1000.

        if(root == null) return 0;
        //recursively check with subtrees
        int left = helper(root.left);
        int right = helper(root.right);
        //unmatch value will reduce contribution of a subtree to 0
        if(root.left != null && root.val != root.left.val) left = 0;
        if(root.right != null && root.val != root.right.val) right = 0;
        //update max path
        max = Math.max(max, left + right);
        //return current subtree's contribution
        return Math.max(left, right) + 1;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
DFS with recursion\
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
In the recursion, we update the global variable with the longest path possible within the current subtree, and then return this subtree's contribution for a long path for its parent tree. Note that we need to compare current node's value to a child's value to determine if the contribution coming from that child need to be reduced to 0.
