## Keyword
Tree, Traversal

## Problem description
```
Given a binary tree, return the vertical order traversal of its nodes values.

For each node at position (X, Y), its left and right children respectively will be at positions (X-1, Y-1) and (X+1, Y-1).

Running a vertical line from X = -infinity to X = +infinity, whenever the vertical line touches some nodes, we report the values of the nodes in order from top to bottom (decreasing Y coordinates).

If two nodes have the same position, then the value of the node that is reported first is the value that is smaller.

Return an list of non-empty reports in order of X coordinate.  Every report will have a list of values of nodes.

 

Example 1:



Input: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[9],[3,15],[20],[7]]
Explanation: 
Without loss of generality, we can assume the root node is at position (0, 0):
Then, the node with value 9 occurs at position (-1, -1);
The nodes with values 3 and 15 occur at positions (0, 0) and (0, -2);
The node with value 20 occurs at position (1, -1);
The node with value 7 occurs at position (2, -2).
Example 2:



Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Output: [[4],[2],[1,5,6],[3],[7]]
Explanation: 
The node with value 5 and the node with value 6 have the same position according to the given scheme.
However, in the report "[1,5,6]", the node value of 5 comes first since 5 is smaller than 6.
 

Note:

The tree will have between 1 and 1000 nodes.
Each node's value will be between 0 and 1000.

## 3/20/2020 DFS recursion

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    List<Point> location;
    public List<List<Integer>> verticalTraversal(TreeNode root) {
        //use DFS to save every node's value and it's location
        location = new ArrayList<>();
        helper(root, 0, 0);
        //sort all the nodes according to its x, then y, then val
        Collections.sort(location, (p1, p2) -> {
            if(p1.x != p2.x) return p1.x - p2.x;
            if(p1.y != p2.y) return p1.y - p2.y;
            return p1.val - p2.val;
        });
        //add all the nodes to ans list according to their sorted order
        List<List<Integer>> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        int curX = location.get(0).x - 1;
        for(var point : location){
            //create new list in answer list accordingly
            if(curX < point.x){
                ans.add(new ArrayList<>());
                curX++;
            }
            ans.get(ans.size() - 1).add(point.val);
        }
        return ans;
    }
    private void helper(TreeNode root, int x, int y){
        //base case
        if(root == null) return;
        //store location and value of the node
        location.add(new Point(x, y, root.val));
        //dfs children
        helper(root.left, x - 1, y + 1);
        helper(root.right, x + 1, y + 1);
    }
}
class Point{
    int x;
    int y;
    int val;
    Point(int x, int y, int val){
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.val = val;
    }
}

## Complexity Analyze
DFS recursion\
Time complexity: O(nlogn) \
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Use DFS to traverse the tree to get node's location and values. Then we can sort these nodes according to their location and values.
