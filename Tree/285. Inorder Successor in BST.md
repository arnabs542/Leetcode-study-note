## Keyword
BST

## Problem description
```
Given a binary search tree and a node in it, find the in-order successor of that node in the BST.

The successor of a node p is the node with the smallest key greater than p.val.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [2,1,3], p = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: 1's in-order successor node is 2. Note that both p and the return value is of TreeNode type.
Example 2:


Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], p = 6
Output: null
Explanation: There is no in-order successor of the current node, so the answer is null.
 

Note:

If the given node has no in-order successor in the tree, return null.
It's guaranteed that the values of the tree are unique.

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode inorderSuccessor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p) {
        //if the node has right child, then inorder success is the left most element in the right branch
        if(p.right != null){
            TreeNode leftMost = p.right;
            //go as left as possible
            while(leftMost.left != null){
                leftMost = leftMost.left;
            }
            return leftMost;
        }
        //otherwise, we have to locate the node with binary search
        TreeNode leftTurn = null;
        while(root.val != p.val){
            if(root.val < p.val) root = root.right;
            else{
                leftTurn = root;
                root = root.left;
            } 
        }
        //the next inorder successor is the last left turn parent during the search
        return leftTurn;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
inorder DFS with iteration when the right child exists, binary search when it doesn't\
Time complexity: O(n) Usually it's going to be O(Hpâ€‹) in the best case, when node p has a right child. Here Hp is the height of node p. O(Dp) if no right child. Here Dp is a the depth of node p. But the BST can be skewered in 1 line\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
The problem has two parts: When p has right child, we need to find the left most node starting from the right child; When p has no right child, we need to find the first parent node that makes a left turn during the search from root to node p.
