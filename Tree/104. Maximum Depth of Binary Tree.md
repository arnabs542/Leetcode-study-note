## Keyword
Tree

## Problem description
```
Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:

Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
return its depth = 3.
```
## 2/12/2020 Recursion DFS

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int maxDepth(TreeNode root) {
        //base case
        if(root == null) return 0;
        //recursion
        return Math.max(maxDepth(root.left), maxDepth(root.right)) + 1;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Recursion(DFS)\
Time complexity: O(n) \
Space complexity: O(n) In the worst case, the tree is completely unbalanced, e.g. each node has only left child node, the recursion call would occur N times (the height of the tree), therefore the storage to keep the call stack would be O(N). But in the best case (the tree is completely balanced), the height of the tree would be \log(N)log(N). Therefore, the space complexity in this case would be O(log(N)).

## Notes
Use recursion to help find out if the left half of the tree is mirrored from the right half of the tree. Note that the recursion is similar to depth first search

## 2/12/2020 Stack iteration

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int maxDepth(TreeNode root) {
        //stack to store nodes
        Stack<TreeNode> stack = new Stack<>();
        //stack to store depth numbers
        Stack<Integer> depths = new Stack<>();
        stack.push(root);
        depths.push(1);
        //the overall depth
        int depth = 0;
        //DFS through the tree
        while(!stack.empty()){
            TreeNode t = stack.pop();
            int current_depth = depths.pop();
            if(t != null){
                //only update actual depth when the node is not null
                depth = Math.max(depth, current_depth);
                stack.push(t.right);
                stack.push(t.left);
                depths.push(current_depth + 1);
                depths.push(current_depth + 1);
            }
        }
        return depth;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
iteratioin using stack\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(n).

## Notes
In the iteration version, we DFS the tree with the help of a stack. Note that we also use another stack to keep track of the tree height(depth)

## Key points
Corner cases: when the list is empty\
API: Stack.push(), Stack.pop(), Stack.isEmpty()
