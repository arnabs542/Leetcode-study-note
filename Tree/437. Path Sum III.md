## Keyword
Tree, DFS

## Problem description
```
You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value.

Find the number of paths that sum to a given value.

The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

The tree has no more than 1,000 nodes and the values are in the range -1,000,000 to 1,000,000.

Example:

root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], sum = 8

      10
     /  \
    5   -3
   / \    \
  3   2   11
 / \   \
3  -2   1

Return 3. The paths that sum to 8 are:

1.  5 -> 3
2.  5 -> 2 -> 1
3. -3 -> 11
```

        if(root == null) return 0;
        //find number of path starting from the current node down
        int cur = findSum(root, sum);
        //recursively find all path starting from all nodes
        return cur + pathSum(root.left, sum) + pathSum(root.right, sum);
    }
    //find the sum starting from the root
    private int findSum(TreeNode root, int sum){
        //base case
        if(root == null) return 0;
        //recursive case
        return findSum(root.left, sum - root.val) + findSum(root.right, sum - root.val) + (root.val == sum ? 1 : 0);
    }
}
```

Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
In this DFS solution, we break the problem down to 2 nested problem: 1 if starting from the current node down, how many path can we find? 2 if we are to calculate path starting from the root node, how do we calculate total path number? Then we solve these two problems in their own DFS recursion and nest them together.

    int ans;
    int k;
    Map<Integer, Integer> hmp;
    public int pathSum(TreeNode root, int sum) {
        ans = 0;
        k = sum;
        hmp = new HashMap<>();
        hmp.put(0, 1);
        countSum(root, 0);
        return ans;
    }
    //find the sum starting from the root
    private void countSum(TreeNode root, int prefix){
        //base case
        if(root == null) return;
        //prefix sum so far
        int sum = prefix + root.val;
        //target to look in previous prefix sums
        int target = sum - k;
        //check hashtable for number of possible prefix sums that can be substrated
        ans += hmp.getOrDefault(target, 0);
        //add the current prefix sum into the hash map for further search
        hmp.put(sum, hmp.getOrDefault(sum, 0) + 1);
        //recursively check subtrees
        countSum(root.left, sum);
        countSum(root.right, sum);
        //remove the current sum from the hashmap so it matches the last function stack
        hmp.put(sum, hmp.get(sum) - 1);
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
We can use a hashtable to keep track of the number appearance of each previous prefix path sum before the current node. And for the current node, we calculate the prefix path sum, and look for the number of previous prefix path sum that equals to target where target = current sum - k, then add this number to the total number of possible path sum. Note that we have to put entry (0, 1) in the hashtable before the search starts, because it's possible a prefix path sum is equal to the k.
