## Keyword
Tree, Preorder DFS

## Problem description
```
Given an n-ary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values.

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).

 

Example 1:



Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
Output: [[1],[3,2,4],[5,6]]
Example 2:



Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
Output: [[1],[2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9,10],[11,12,13],[14]]
 

Constraints:

The height of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to 1000
The total number of nodes is between [0, 10^4]

## 3/20/2020 BFS with queue

```java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> children;

    public Node() {}

    public Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
    }

    public Node(int _val, List<Node> _children) {
        val = _val;
        children = _children;
    }
};
*/
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> levelOrder(Node root) {
        List<List<Integer>> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        //when root is empty
        if(root == null) return ans;
        //use queue for BFS traversal
        Queue<Node> q = new LinkedList<>();
        q.add(root);
        while(!q.isEmpty()){
            //1 level at a time
            int size = q.size();
            //an array to store current level's node values
            List<Integer> level = new ArrayList<>();
            while(size-- > 0){
                Node cur = q.poll();
                level.add(cur.val);
                for(var child : cur.children){
                    q.add(child);
                }
            }
            ans.add(level);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

BFS with queue\
Time complexity: O(n) \
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Standard BFS solution implemented with queue. This is a typical level by level BFS search

## Key points
Corner cases: when the tree is empty\
API: Queue.add(), Queue.poll()

## 3/20/2020 recursion

```java
class Solution {

    private List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();

    public List<List<Integer>> levelOrder(Node root) {
        if (root != null) traverseNode(root, 0);
        return result;
    }

    private void traverseNode(Node node, int level) {
        if (result.size() <= level) {
            result.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        result.get(level).add(node.val);
        for (Node child : node.children) {
            traverseNode(child, level + 1);
        }
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
recursion\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(logn)

## Notes
We can use recursion for this problem. Often we can't use recursion for a breadth-first search (which is what a level-order traversal is). That is because breadth-first search is based on using a queue, whereas recursion is using the runtime stack and so is suited to depth-first search. In this case, however, we are putting all the values into a list before returning it. This means it's okay for us to get them in a different order to what they'll appear in the final list. As long as we know what level each node is from, and ensure they are in the correct order within each level, it will work.
