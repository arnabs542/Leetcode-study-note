## LeetCode link(Medium)
https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-pruning/

## Keyword
Tree, DFS

## Problem description
```
We are given the head node root of a binary tree, where additionally every node's value is either a 0 or a 1.

Return the same tree where every subtree (of the given tree) not containing a 1 has been removed.

(Recall that the subtree of a node X is X, plus every node that is a descendant of X.)

Example 1:
Input: [1,null,0,0,1]
Output: [1,null,0,null,1]
 
Explanation: 
Only the red nodes satisfy the property "every subtree not containing a 1".
The diagram on the right represents the answer.


Example 2:
Input: [1,0,1,0,0,0,1]
Output: [1,null,1,null,1]



Example 3:
Input: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0]
Output: [1,1,0,1,1,null,1]



Note:

The binary tree will have at most 100 nodes.
The value of each node will only be 0 or 1.

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }

 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode pruneTree(TreeNode root) {
        prune(root);
        return root;
    }
    private boolean prune(TreeNode root){
        //base case
        if(root == null) return false;
        boolean left = prune(root.left);
        boolean right = prune(root.right);
        if(!left) root.left = null;
        if(!right) root.right = null;
        return (left || right) || root.val != 0;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
DFS\
Time complexity: O(n) \
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Use DFS to prune left and right subtree of the current node, then return a boolean for its parent to decide if it wants to prune the current node.
