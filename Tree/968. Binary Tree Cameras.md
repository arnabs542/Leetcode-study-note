https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-cameras/

## Keyword
Tree, recursion, contribution, greedy

## Problem description
```
Given a binary tree, we install cameras on the nodes of the tree. 

Each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.

Calculate the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.

 

Example 1:


Input: [0,0,null,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.
Example 2:


Input: [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement.

Note:

The number of nodes in the given tree will be in the range [1, 1000].
Every node has value 0.

 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }

    int camera;
    public int minCameraCover(TreeNode root) {
        camera = 0;
        if(helper(root) == 0) camera++;
        return camera;
    }
    private int helper(TreeNode root){
        //base case
        if(root == null) return -1;
        //recursively calculate subtree's camera lines
        int left = helper(root.left);
        int right = helper(root.right);
        //if any child needs coverage, we need a camera on this node
        if(left == 0 || right == 0){
            camera++;
            return 2;
        }
        //if child has camera, this node is already covered
        if(left == 2 || right == 2) return 1;
        //both children are covered, or if this node is a leaf node, then it needs coverage
        return 0;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
DFS with recursion\
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
In this recursion solution, we mark each node's state as "uncovered", "covered", "camera" and return this state. Then for any node, we check if its child needs coverage and place cameras as needed. At its core, this solution is a greedy solution.
