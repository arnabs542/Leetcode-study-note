https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/

## Keyword
Tree, DFS, Binary search

## Problem description
```
Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

Note:

Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

Example:

Input: 
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \  /
4  5 6

Output: 6

## 3/27/2020 DFS recursion

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int countNodes(TreeNode root) {
        return root != null ? 1 + countNodes(root.left) + countNodes(root.right) : 0;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
DFS\
Time complexity: O(n) \
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Naive dfs traversal. This solution does not profit from the fact that the tree is complete.

/**

class Solution {
    int depth;
    public int countNodes(TreeNode root) {
        //if the tree is empty
        if(root == null) return 0;
        //compute tree depth
        depth = 0;
        TreeNode cur = root;
        while(cur.left != null){
            cur = cur.left;

        }
        //if depth is 0, there's only 1 node
        if(depth == 0) return 1;
        //amount of nodes leaves if it's full tree
        int full = (int)Math.pow(2, depth);
        //use binary search to find how many leaves are at the bottom
        int l = 0, r = full;
        while(l < r){
            int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
            //search condition
            if(!exists(m, root)) r = m;
            else l = m + 1;
        }
        //l is the index of the first missing leaf, and the number of leaves at the bottom level
        //the tree contains 2 ^ depth nodes on the first depth levels
        return (int)Math.pow(2, depth) - 1 + l;
    }
    private boolean exists(int index, TreeNode root){
        TreeNode cur = root;
        int bottom = (int)Math.pow(2, depth);
        //travel to the bottom level to check if the index leaf is missing
        int l = 0, r = bottom - 1;
        for(int i = 0; i < depth; i++){
            int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
            if(index > m){
                cur = cur.right;
                l = m + 1;
            }
            else{
                cur = cur.left;
                r = m;
            }
        }
        return cur != null;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Binary search\
Time complexity: O((logn) ^ 2) \
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
To find out how many nodes are in the bottom level, we can use a binary search. And each search takes O(logn) to travel from root to the bottom level of the tree. So in total the time complexity of this method is O((logn) ^ 2) which is a lot smaller than the regular O(n) search.

## Key points
Corner cases: when the tree is empty & when the tree only has 1 node(root)\
