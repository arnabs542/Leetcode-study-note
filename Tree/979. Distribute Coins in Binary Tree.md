## Keyword
Tree, recursion, contribution

## Problem description
```
Given the root of a binary tree with N nodes, each node in the tree has node.val coins, and there are N coins total.

In one move, we may choose two adjacent nodes and move one coin from one node to another.  (The move may be from parent to child, or from child to parent.)

Return the number of moves required to make every node have exactly one coin.

 

Example 1:



Input: [3,0,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: From the root of the tree, we move one coin to its left child, and one coin to its right child.
Example 2:



Input: [0,3,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: From the left child of the root, we move two coins to the root [taking two moves].  Then, we move one coin from the root of the tree to the right child.
Example 3:



Input: [1,0,2]
Output: 2
Example 4:



Input: [1,0,0,null,3]
Output: 4
 

Note:

1<= N <= 100
0 <= node.val <= N
```

        int cur = 1 - root.val;
        //total number of coins needed for the current subtree
        int total = left + right + cur;
        //update total moves need to balance the coin for the current node
        move += Math.abs(total);
        //return number of coins needed for the current subtree
        return total;
    }
}

## Complexity Analyze
DFS with recursion\
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
We can count the amount of coins the current subtree needed, then update total number of moves to fullfill this need while returning the number to its parent to count new total of coins needed.

    }
}
```

Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
In this solution, we count number of excess coins the current subtree has and let the parent node worry about moves.
