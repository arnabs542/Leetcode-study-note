## Keyword
Tree

## Problem description
```
Given the root of a binary tree, each node in the tree has a distinct value.

After deleting all nodes with a value in to_delete, we are left with a forest (a disjoint union of trees).

Return the roots of the trees in the remaining forest.  You may return the result in any order.

 

Example 1:



Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], to_delete = [3,5]
Output: [[1,2,null,4],[6],[7]]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the given tree is at most 1000.
Each node has a distinct value between 1 and 1000.
to_delete.length <= 1000
to_delete contains distinct values between 1 and 1000.

        return ans;
    }
    private TreeNode helper(TreeNode root, boolean isRoot) {
        //base case
        if (root == null) {
            return null;
        }
        //wether the current node is to be deleted
        boolean delete = set.contains(root.val);
        //if the current node is a root it is not to be deleted, add it to the list
        if (isRoot && !delete) {
            ans.add(root);
        }
        //recursion for children
        root.left = helper(root.left, delete);
        root.right = helper(root.right, delete);
        
        return delete ? null : root;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n) \
Space complexity: O(n + h) where h is the height of the tree

## Notes
For each layer of the recursion, we pass a boolean for the layer to know if the current node is a root or not. Then we determine if the current node is to be deleted or not, then use this information to call recursion(wether a child is a root depends on if current node is deleted or not).
