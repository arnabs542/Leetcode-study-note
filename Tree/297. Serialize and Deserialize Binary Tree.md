## Keyword
Tree, String

## Problem description
```
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

Example: 

You may serialize the following tree:

    1
   / \
  2   3
     / \
    4   5

as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"
Clarification: The above format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.

## 2/19/2020 recursion

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
public class Codec {

    // Encodes a tree to a single string.
    public String serialize(TreeNode root) {
        //use a stringbuilder to store the result
        StringBuilder s = new StringBuilder();
        //use recursion to DFS the tree
        this.serializeDFS(root, s);
        return s.toString();
    }
    private void serializeDFS(TreeNode root, StringBuilder s){
        //append 'n' when the node is null
        if(root == null){
            s.append("n,");
            return;
        }
        //insert the char into the string
        s.append(root.val);
        s.append(',');
        //recursively handle both children
        serializeDFS(root.left, s);
        serializeDFS(root.right, s);
    }

    // Decodes your encoded data to tree.
    public TreeNode deserialize(String data) {
        //split the string with ','
        String[] dataArray = data.split(",");
        //use a counter to count current position in the data
        int[] counter = new int[1];
        counter[0] = 0;
        return deserializeDFS(dataArray, counter);
    }
    //recursively build the tree
    private TreeNode deserializeDFS(String[] dataArray, int[] counter){
        //base case
        if(dataArray[counter[0]].equals("n")) {
            counter[0]++;
            return null;
        }
        //create the current node
        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(Integer.parseInt(dataArray[counter[0]]));
        counter[0]++;
        root.left = deserializeDFS(dataArray, counter);
        root.right = deserializeDFS(dataArray, counter);
        return root;
    }
}

// Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
// Codec codec = new Codec();
// codec.deserialize(codec.serialize(root));
```

## Complexity Analyze
recursion DFS\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
For both serialization and deserialization, we use the recursion to do preorder DFS. String manipulation is also part of this problem. Note that we should use StringBuilder not String concatenation to save time and space.

## Key points
Corner cases: \
API: StringBuilder.append(), String.split(), Integer.parseInt()
