## Keyword
BST, Stack

## Problem description
```
Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find k values in the BST that are closest to the target.

Note:

Given target value is a floating point.
You may assume k is always valid, that is: k â‰¤ total nodes.
You are guaranteed to have only one unique set of k values in the BST that are closest to the target.
Example:

Input: root = [4,2,5,1,3], target = 3.714286, and k = 2

    4
   / \
  2   5
 / \
1   3

Output: [4,3]
Follow up:
Assume that the BST is balanced, could you solve it in less than O(n) runtime (where n = total nodes)?

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(logn + k) where getting major pivot nodes will cost O(logn) time and later building the answer list will cost O(k)\
Space complexity: O(max(logn, k))

## Notes
First, we traverse down the BST and collect major pivot nodes that are target's successors and predecessors. Then try to find k closest elements of target. For each element we get from top of the stack, we push some immediate next nodes of that element from the BST to the stack. This way the top element of the stack is always the immediate next element of the target. Note we can put the equal condition for on either successor side or predecessor side, even this might result in two different stack compositions, by calling getNext() later, we will still get the same result list.
