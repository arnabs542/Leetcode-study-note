## Keyword
Tree, recursion, contribution, DP

## Problem description
```
The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree". It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:

Input: [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]

     3
    / \
   2   3
    \   \ 
     3   1

Output: 7 
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
Example 2:

Input: [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]

     3
    / \
   4   5
  / \   \ 
 1   3   1

Output: 9
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.

class Solution {
    public int rob(TreeNode root) {
        int[] ans = helper(root);
        return Math.max(ans[0], ans[1]);
    }
    //int[0] is the max profit if steal this node, int[1] is the max profit if not steal this node
    public int[] helper(TreeNode root){
        //base case
        if(root == null){
            //if it's an empty node, we need to force 
            return new int[]{0, 0};
        }
        //recursively calculate possible results from subtrees
        int[] left = helper(root.left);
        int[] right = helper(root.right);
        //the max profit if steal the current node
        int maxInclude = root.val + left[1] + right[1];
        //the max profit if not steal the current node
        int maxExclude = Math.max(left[0], left[1]) + Math.max(right[0], right[1]);
        //return two possible profits
        return new int[]{maxInclude, maxExclude};
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
By observation, we realize for each subtree, there are two possible max profit: First, if we rob the root node; Second, if we skip the root node. The reason for having these two max profit is for the parent level to decide what is the max profit for its subtree, and the recursion goes on. We can return these two profits to form a DP algorithm in recursion.
