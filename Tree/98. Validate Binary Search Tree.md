## Keyword
BST

## Problem description
```
Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 

Example 1:

    2
   / \
  1   3

Input: [2,1,3]
Output: true
Example 2:

    5
   / \
  1   4
     / \
    3   6

Input: [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
Output: false
Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.

/**

 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }

class Solution {
    public boolean isValidBST(TreeNode root) {
        return helper(root, null, null);
    }
    private boolean helper(TreeNode root, Integer lower, Integer upper){
        //base case
        if(root == null) return true;
        // pre-order DFS
        int val = root.val;
        //check is root value is in range
        if(lower != null && val <= lower) return false;
        if(upper != null && val >= upper) return false;
        //check is children values are in range
        if(!helper(root.left, lower, val)) return false;
        if(!helper(root.right, val, upper)) return false;
           
        return true;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Recursion(DFS) Pre-order\
Time complexity: O(n) \
Space complexity: O(n) In the worst case, the tree is completely unbalanced, e.g. each node has only left child node, the recursion call would occur N times (the height of the tree), therefore the storage to keep the call stack would be O(N). But in the best case (the tree is completely balanced), the height of the tree would be log(N). Therefore, the space complexity in this case would be O(log(N)).

## Notes
Use recursion to perform DFS(pre-order) to the tree. Check if the root is in range, then its children repectively.

## 2/13/2020 Stack iteration

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }

 */
class Solution {
    public boolean isValidBST(TreeNode root) {
        Stack<TreeNode> tree = new Stack<>();
        Stack<Integer> lower = new Stack<>(), upper = new Stack<>();
        //start with the root
        tree.push(root);
        lower.push(null);
        upper.push(null);
        //iterate through the tree
        while(!tree.isEmpty()){
            TreeNode t = tree.pop();
            Integer lower_b = lower.pop(), upper_b = upper.pop();
            //only check ranges when the node is not null
            if(t != null){
                //test node's value with the range
                if(lower_b != null && t.val <= lower_b.intValue()) return false;
                if(upper_b != null && t.val >= upper_b.intValue()) return false;
                //add node's children along with their corresponding range
                tree.push(t.right);
                tree.push(t.left);
                lower.push(t.val);
                lower.push(lower_b);
                upper.push(upper_b);
                upper.push(t.val);
            }

## Complexity Analyze
iteratioin using stack\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(n).

## Notes
In the iteration version, we DFS the tree with the help of a stack. Note that we also use another two stacks to keep track of the lower and upper bound of the node value

## Key points

API: Stack.push(), Stack.pop(), Stack.isEmpty()

## 2/13/2020 Community in-order traverse using iteration

```java
class Solution {
  public boolean isValidBST(TreeNode root) {
    Stack<TreeNode> stack = new Stack();
    double inorder = - Double.MAX_VALUE;

    while (!stack.isEmpty() || root != null) {
      while (root != null) {
        stack.push(root);
        root = root.left;
      }
      root = stack.pop();
      // If next element in inorder traversal
      // is smaller than the previous one
      // that's not BST.
      if (root.val <= inorder) return false;
      inorder = root.val;
      root = root.right;
    }
    return true;
  }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
inorder iteratioin using stack\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(n).

## Notes
When we inorder traverse through the tree, we can examine if the previous val is less than the next to determine if the tree is a BST. Note that we need to use a value that is smaller than Integer.MIN_VALUE to start the comparison process.
