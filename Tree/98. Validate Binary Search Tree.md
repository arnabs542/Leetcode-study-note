## Keyword
BST

## Problem description
```
Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 

Example 1:

    2
   / \
  1   3

Input: [2,1,3]
Output: true
Example 2:

    5
   / \
  1   4
     / \
    3   6

Input: [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
Output: false
Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.

        if(root == null) return true;
        //inorder traversal
        if(!isValidBST(root.left)) return false;
        if(last != null && last >= root.val) return false;
        last = new Integer(root.val);
        if(!isValidBST(root.right)) return false;
        return true;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Recursion(DFS) In-order\
Time complexity: O(n) \
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Use recursion to perform DFS(in-order) to the tree. Check if every node's value is greater than its previous node's value. Note we have to initialize the last value to null so there's no comparison with the first node's value.

## Complexity Analyze
Recursion(DFS) Pre-order\
Time complexity: O(n) \
Space complexity: O(n) In the worst case, the tree is completely unbalanced, e.g. each node has only left child node, the recursion call would occur N times (the height of the tree), therefore the storage to keep the call stack would be O(N). But in the best case (the tree is completely balanced), the height of the tree would be log(N). Therefore, the space complexity in this case would be O(log(N)).

## Notes
Use recursion to perform DFS(pre-order) to the tree. Check if the root is in range, then its children repectively.

```java
class Solution {
  public boolean isValidBST(TreeNode root) {
    Stack<TreeNode> stack = new Stack();
    double inorder = - Double.MAX_VALUE;

    while (!stack.isEmpty() || root != null) {
      while (root != null) {
        stack.push(root);
        root = root.left;
      }
      root = stack.pop();
      // If next element in inorder traversal
      // is smaller than the previous one
      // that's not BST.
      if (root.val <= inorder) return false;
      inorder = root.val;
      root = root.right;
    }
    return true;
  }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
inorder iteratioin using stack\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(n).

## Notes
When we inorder traverse through the tree, we can examine if the previous val is less than the next to determine if the tree is a BST. Note that we need to use a value that is smaller than Integer.MIN_VALUE to start the comparison process.
