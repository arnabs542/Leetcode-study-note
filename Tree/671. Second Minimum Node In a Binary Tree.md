https://leetcode.com/problems/second-minimum-node-in-a-binary-tree/

## Keyword
Tree, Greedy

## Problem description
```
Given a non-empty special binary tree consisting of nodes with the non-negative value, where each node in this tree has exactly two or zero sub-node. If the node has two sub-nodes, then this node's value is the smaller value among its two sub-nodes. More formally, the property root.val = min(root.left.val, root.right.val) always holds.

Given such a binary tree, you need to output the second minimum value in the set made of all the nodes' value in the whole tree.

If no such second minimum value exists, output -1 instead.

Example 1:

Input: 
    2
   / \
  2   5
     / \
    5   7

Output: 5
Explanation: The smallest value is 2, the second smallest value is 5.
 

Example 2:

Input: 
    2
   / \
  2   2

Output: -1
Explanation: The smallest value is 2, but there isn't any second smallest value.

        ans = Long.MAX_VALUE;
        //set the minimum number for the tree
        min = root.val;
        helper(root);
        return ans == Long.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : (int)ans;
    }
    private void helper(TreeNode root) {
        //base case
        if (root == null) {
            return;
        }
        //if current subtree's root is already larger than min number, no need to traverse it
        if (root.val > min) {
            ans = Math.min(ans, root.val);
        }
        //other wise, we need to search both subtrees for the 2nd largest number
        helper(root.left);
        helper(root.right);
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n) \
Space complexity: O(h)

## Notes
Let min = root.val which is the minimum of the entire tree. When traversing the tree at some node, if node.val > min, we know all values in that subtree at node are at least node.val, so there cannot be a better candidate for the second minimum in this subtree. Thus, we do not need to search this subtree.
