## Keyword
BST

## Problem description
```
Given a non-empty binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3]

       1
      / \
     2   3

Output: 6
Example 2:

Input: [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]

   -10
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7

Output: 42

    private int helper(TreeNode root){
        //base case
        if(root == null) return 0;
        //calculate left and right children's best contribution
        int leftMax = Math.max(helper(root.left), 0);
        int rightMax = Math.max(helper(root.right), 0);
        //calculate the max path sum when connecting left and right branch through node
        int maxLeftRight = leftMax + rightMax + root.val;
        //update the total max path sum
        this.maxSum = Math.max(maxLeftRight, this.maxSum);
        //return the current tree's best contribution
        return Math.max(leftMax + root.val, rightMax + root.val);
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
DFS with recursion\
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
When we first look at the problem, it seems that it can easily be solved by recursion. Every recursion call just needs to return the current subtree's best contribution after updating the max possible path sum to the grand total. But the trick is that the contribution can only contains one side of the subtree plus the root while the max possible path sum can be a line connecting both side through the root.\
Also note that there might be negative contributions coming from children. So the true contribution of the subtree of a child should be the max of its contribution and 0(when the entire subtree is not used).
