https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-smaller-numbers-after-self/

## Keyword
BST, Array

## Problem description
```
You are given an integer array nums and you have to return a new counts array. The counts array has the property where counts[i] is the number of smaller elements to the right of nums[i].

Example:

Input: [5,2,6,1]
Output: [2,1,1,0] 
Explanation:
To the right of 5 there are 2 smaller elements (2 and 1).
To the right of 2 there is only 1 smaller element (1).
To the right of 6 there is 1 smaller element (1).
To the right of 1 there is 0 smaller element.

```java
class TreeNode{
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    //count how many nodes are smaller or equal to this node(on the left side of the BST)
    int count = 1;
    //node's value
    int val;
    public TreeNode(int x){
        val = x;
    }
}

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> countSmaller(int[] nums) {
        List<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        //corner case
        if(nums == null || nums.length == 0) return ans;
        //build the BST
        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(nums[nums.length - 1]);
        ans.add(0);
        for(int i = nums.length - 2; i >= 0; i--){
            ans.add(insertNode(root, nums[i]));
        }
        Collections.reverse(ans);
        return ans;
    }
    //method to insert a new node in the BST
    private int insertNode(TreeNode root, int val){
        //count how many existing nodes are smaller than val
        int curCount = 0;
        while(true){
            //add a node to the left of current tree if new value is not bigger than existing node value
            if(val <= root.val){
                //1 more node to the left
                root.count++;
                if(root.left == null){
                    root.left = new TreeNode(val);
                    return curCount;
                }

                else{
                    root = root.left;
                }
            }
            //otherwise, add a node to the right of the current tree
            else{
                //new node will be bigger than all existing nodes on the left
                curCount += root.count;
                if(root.right == null){
                    root.right = new TreeNode(val);
                    return curCount;
                }
                //pass to next layer
                else{
                    root = root.right;

## Complexity Analyze
One pass + BST\
Time complexity: O(n^2) The average complexity of the solution is O(nlogn). But in the worset case, the BST can be a long skewered line, then the complexity is O(n^2)\
Space complexity: O(n) We need extra space to store all values in the tree.

## Notes
For any element, we always have to examine all the elements to its right to count how many elements are smaller than the urrent element. The key is how to reduce the lookup time which is O(n), and a binary tree is perfect for dividing elements to reduce time complexity to O(nlogn) for lookup.

## Complexity Analyze
iteratioin using queue\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: There is additional space required for the search queue. In the worst case, we have to insert O(n) nodes in the queue. Therefore, space complexity is O(n).

## Notes
Instead of recursion, we can also use iteration with the aid of a queue. Each two consecutive nodes in the queue should be equal, and their subtrees a mirror of each other. Initially, the queue contains left and right. Then the algorithm works similarly to BFS, with some key differences. Each time, two nodes are extracted and their values compared. Then, the right and left children of the two nodes are inserted in the queue in opposite order. The algorithm is done when either the queue is empty, or we detect that the tree is not symmetric (i.e. we pull out two consecutive nodes from the queue that are unequal).
