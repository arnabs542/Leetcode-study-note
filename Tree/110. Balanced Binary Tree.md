Tree, DFS, Recursion

## Problem description
```
Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:

a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.

 

Example 1:

Given the following tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]:

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
Return true.

Example 2:

Given the following tree [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]:

       1
      / \
     2   2
    / \
   3   3
  / \
 4   4
Return false.

## 3/21/2020 Recursion DFS

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public boolean isBalanced(TreeNode root) {
        //dfs with recursion
        return helper(root) >= 0;
    }
    private int helper(TreeNode root){
        //base case
        if(root == null) return 0;
        //recursively calculate subtree heights
        int left = helper(root.left);
        int right = helper(root.right);
        //subtree is not balanced
        if(left < 0 || right < 0) return -1;
        //compare subtree heights to report an unbalance or the current tree height
        return Math.abs(left - right) > 1 ? -1 : Math.max(left, right) + 1;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
recursion\
Time complexity: O(n) \
Space complexity: O(n) 
## Notes
Use recursion(DFS) to calculate tree height of left and right subtrees, then do the comparison. Note we can make the code more concise by combining the boolean status of balanced or not with the tree height. This way we only need 1 recursion to solve the problem
