## Keyword

## Problem description
```
Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

Example:
Given a binary tree
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    
Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

    public int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        max = 0;
        helper(root);
        return max;
    }
    private int helper(TreeNode root){
        //base case
        if(root == null) return 0;
        //calculate both subtrees' contribution
        int left = helper(root.left);
        int right = helper(root.right);
        //update the global max
        max = Math.max(max, left + right);
        //return this subtree's contribution
        return Math.max(left, right) + 1;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
DFS with recursion\
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
In the recursion, we update the global variable with the longest path possible within the current subtree, and then return this subtree's contribution for a long path for its parent tree.
