## Keyword
Tree, DFS

## Problem description
```
Given a binary tree root and an integer target, delete all the leaf nodes with value target.

Note that once you delete a leaf node with value target, if it's parent node becomes a leaf node and has the value target, it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you can't).

 

Example 1:



Input: root = [1,2,3,2,null,2,4], target = 2
Output: [1,null,3,null,4]
Explanation: Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed (Picture in left). 
After removing, new nodes become leaf nodes with value (target = 2) (Picture in center).
Example 2:



Input: root = [1,3,3,3,2], target = 3
Output: [1,3,null,null,2]
Example 3:



Input: root = [1,2,null,2,null,2], target = 2
Output: [1]
Explanation: Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed at each step.
Example 4:

Input: root = [1,1,1], target = 1
Output: []
Example 5:

Input: root = [1,2,3], target = 1
Output: [1,2,3]
 

Constraints:

1 <= target <= 1000
Each tree has at most 3000 nodes.
Each node's value is between [1, 1000].

## 3/22/2020 DFS

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode removeLeafNodes(TreeNode root, int target) {
        return helper(root, target) ? root : null;
    }
    private boolean helper(TreeNode root, int target){
        //base case
        if(root == null) return false;
        boolean left = helper(root.left, target);
        boolean right = helper(root.right, target);
        if(!left) root.left = null;
        if(!right) root.right = null;
        return left || right || root.val != target;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
DFS\
Time complexity: O(n) \
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Use DFS to prune left and right subtree of the current node, then return a boolean for its parent to decide if it wants to prune the current node.
