## LeetCode link(Easy)
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference-in-bst/

## Keyword
Tree, recursion, inorder

## Problem description
```
Given a binary search tree with non-negative values, find the minimum absolute difference between values of any two nodes.

Example:

Input:

   1
    \
     3
    /
   2

Output:
1

Explanation:
The minimum absolute difference is 1, which is the difference between 2 and 1 (or between 2 and 3).
 

Note:

There are at least two nodes in this BST.

## Complexity Analyze
DFS with recursion\
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Inorder traversal of BST allows us to compare elements between every two adjacent elements in ascending order.
