## Keyword
BST

## Problem description
```
Given the root node of a binary search tree (BST) and a value. You need to find the node in the BST that the node's value equals the given value. Return the subtree rooted with that node. If such node doesn't exist, you should return NULL.

For example, 

Given the tree:
        4
       / \
      2   7
     / \
    1   3

And the value to search: 2
You should return this subtree:

      2     
     / \   
    1   3
In the example above, if we want to search the value 5, since there is no node with value 5, we should return NULL.

Note that an empty tree is represented by NULL, therefore you would see the expected output (serialized tree format) as [], not null.

## 3/30/2020 iteration

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode searchBST(TreeNode root, int val) {
        TreeNode ans = root;
        while(ans != null && ans.val != val){
            if(ans.val < val) ans = ans.right;
            else ans = ans.left;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
iteration\
Time complexity: O(H)
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Based on BST's property, we can just percolate down on the tree to find the right node.

## 3/30/2020 recursion

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode searchBST(TreeNode root, int val) {
        //if the current root is the ans
        if (root == null || root.val == val){return root;}
        //do the comparison
        return root.val > val ? searchBST(root.left, val) : searchBST(root.right, val);
    }
}
```
