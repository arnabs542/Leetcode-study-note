## Keyword
BST, tree structure

## Problem description
```
Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

Search for a node to remove.
If the node is found, delete the node.
Note: Time complexity should be O(height of tree).

Example:

root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
key = 3

    5
   / \
  3   6
 / \   \
2   4   7

Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.

One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the following BST.

    5
   / \
  4   6
 /     \
2       7

Another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7].

    5
   / \
  2   6
   \   \
    4   7

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.

 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }

 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode deleteNode(TreeNode root, int key) {
        //when the node is empty
        if (root == null) return null;
        //delete from the right subtree
        if (key > root.val) root.right = deleteNode(root.right, key);
        //delete from the left subtree
        else if (key < root.val) root.left = deleteNode(root.left, key);
        //delete the current node
        else{
            //if the current node has left subtree
            if (root.left != null){
                //find the right most child of the left subtree
                TreeNode rightMost = root.left;
                while (rightMost.right != null) rightMost = rightMost.right;
                //connect right subtree to left right most child
                rightMost.right = root.right;
                return root.left;
            }
            //if left subtree doesn't exist, we can connect the right subtree directly
            else{
                return root.right;
            }
        }
        return root;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Recursion\
Time complexity: O(H) \
Space complexity: O(H) 

## Notes
To delete a node from a tree, we have to change tree's sturcture. So the best way to do it with recursion is to return the current subtree for its parent to connect. And during the stack call, we can modify the current subtree's structure if needed. Note that we can take advantange of the property of the binary tree and travel down using only logn time
