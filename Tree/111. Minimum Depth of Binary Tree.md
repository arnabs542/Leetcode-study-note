## Keyword
Tree, DFS, Recursion

## Problem description
```
Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:

Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
return its minimum depth = 2.
```
## 3/21/2020 Recursion DFS

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int minDepth(TreeNode root) {
        //base case
        if(root == null) return 0;
        //recusive case
        int left = minDepth(root.left);
        int right = minDepth(root.right);
        //when both children don't exist, 1 is the tree minDepth
        if(left == 0 && right == 0) return 1;
        //when one of the child doesn't exist, the tree minDepth is the minDepth of the other subtree
        if(left == 0) return right + 1;
        if(right == 0) return left + 1;
        //when both child exist, we need to find the smaller one of the minDepth
        return Math.min(left, right) + 1;
    }
}
```

Time complexity: O(n) \
Space complexity: O(n) 
## Notes
Use recursion(DFS) to calculate tree minimum depth of left and right subtrees, then do the comparison to find the minimum depth of the current tree. Note if one side of the subtree doesn't exist, it doesn't count as a 0 depth subtree. We have to find a path to the nearest leaf.
