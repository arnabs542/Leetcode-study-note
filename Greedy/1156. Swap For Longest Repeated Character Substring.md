## Keyword
Greedy

## Problem description
```
Given a string text, we are allowed to swap two of the characters in the string. Find the length of the longest substring with repeated characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: text = "ababa"
Output: 3
Explanation: We can swap the first 'b' with the last 'a', or the last 'b' with the first 'a'. Then, the longest repeated character substring is "aaa", which its length is 3.
Example 2:

Input: text = "aaabaaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Swap 'b' with the last 'a' (or the first 'a'), and we get longest repeated character substring "aaaaaa", which its length is 6.
Example 3:

Input: text = "aaabbaaa"
Output: 4
Example 4:

Input: text = "aaaaa"
Output: 5
Explanation: No need to swap, longest repeated character substring is "aaaaa", length is 5.
Example 5:

Input: text = "abcdef"
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= text.length <= 20000
text consist of lowercase English characters only.

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(N)  
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
For each character, find max length of single repeating group, and plus 1 if there are more than 1 chunk because other chunk can shift 1 character to extends the longest single repeating group. Also find the max length of combo repeating group: aaaxaaa, and plus 1 if there are more than 2 chunks because other chunk can shift 1 character to replace 'x'.
