## Problem description
```
You are given an array nums of n positive integers.

You can perform two types of operations on any element of the array any number of times:

If the element is even, divide it by 2.
For example, if the array is [1,2,3,4], then you can do this operation on the last element, and the array will be [1,2,3,2].
If the element is odd, multiply it by 2.
For example, if the array is [1,2,3,4], then you can do this operation on the first element, and the array will be [2,2,3,4].
The deviation of the array is the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.

Return the minimum deviation the array can have after performing some number of operations.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 1
Explanation: You can transform the array to [1,2,3,2], then to [2,2,3,2], then the deviation will be 3 - 2 = 1.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,1,5,20,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: You can transform the array after two operations to [4,2,5,5,3], then the deviation will be 5 - 2 = 3.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [2,10,8]
Output: 3
 

Constraints:

n == nums.length
2 <= n <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 109

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumDeviation(int[] nums) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> evens = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        int minimum = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        //put each number's max into the priorityqueue
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num % 2 == 0) {
                evens.offer(num);
                minimum = Math.min(minimum, num);
            } else {
                evens.offer(num * 2);
                minimum = Math.min(minimum, num * 2);
            }
        }
        int minDeviation = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        //greedily cutting the largest number each time
        while (!evens.isEmpty()) {
            int currentValue = evens.poll();
            //compute the current minimum deviation
            minDeviation = Math.min(minDeviation, currentValue - minimum);
            if (currentValue % 2 == 0) {
                evens.offer(currentValue / 2);
                minimum = Math.min(minimum, currentValue / 2);
            } else {
                // if the maximum is odd, break and return
                break;
            }
        }
        return minDeviation;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(nlogmlogn)  
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Basically, each number in the array has a range. For odd number, it's [odd, odd * 2], for even number, it's [even/2/2.../2, even]. The best setup for each number lie somewhere in the range. First, we can make all the number to the right bound(maximum). Then, each time, we pick the largest number of all, and decrease it by dividing it by 2. The reason we can do this is, if we pick any other number to do so, the deviation will not change, so picking the largest number to shrink must be a step towards the best setup. We keep doing this until the largest number is odd can it cannot be shrunk anymore.
