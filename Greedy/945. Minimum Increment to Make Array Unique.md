https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-increment-to-make-array-unique/

## Keyword
Sorting, greedy

## Problem description
```
Given an array of integers A, a move consists of choosing any A[i], and incrementing it by 1.

Return the least number of moves to make every value in A unique.

 

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation:  After 1 move, the array could be [1, 2, 3].
Example 2:

Input: [3,2,1,2,1,7]
Output: 6
Explanation:  After 6 moves, the array could be [3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 7].
It can be shown with 5 or less moves that it is impossible for the array to have all unique values.
 

Note:

0 <= A.length <= 40000
0 <= A[i] < 40000
```
## 6/9/2020 Sorting + Greedy

```java
class Solution {
    public int minIncrementForUnique(int[] A) {
        //sort the array
        Arrays.sort(A);
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < A.length; ++i) {
            //increase the current number to be at its desired value
            if (A[i] <= A[i - 1]) {
                res += A[i - 1] + 1 - A[i];
                A[i] = A[i - 1] + 1;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Sorting + Greedy\
Time complexity: O(nlogn)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
We sort the numbers first. Then traverse the list and increase the number to its minimum desired value. Then difference would be the number of moves.
