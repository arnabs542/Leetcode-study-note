## Problem description
```
By now, you are given a secret signature consisting of character 'D' and 'I'. 'D' represents a decreasing relationship between two numbers, 'I' represents an increasing relationship between two numbers. And our secret signature was constructed by a special integer array, which contains uniquely all the different number from 1 to n (n is the length of the secret signature plus 1). For example, the secret signature "DI" can be constructed by array [2,1,3] or [3,1,2], but won't be constructed by array [3,2,4] or [2,1,3,4], which are both illegal constructing special string that can't represent the "DI" secret signature.

On the other hand, now your job is to find the lexicographically smallest permutation of [1, 2, ... n] could refer to the given secret signature in the input.

Example 1:
Input: "I"
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: [1,2] is the only legal initial spectial string can construct secret signature "I", where the number 1 and 2 construct an increasing relationship.
Example 2:
Input: "DI"
Output: [2,1,3]
Explanation: Both [2,1,3] and [3,1,2] can construct the secret signature "DI", 
but since we want to find the one with the smallest lexicographical permutation, you need to output [2,1,3]
Note:

The input string will only contain the character 'D' and 'I'.
The length of input string is a positive integer and will not exceed 10,000

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] findPermutation(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        //use stack to help reverse numbers
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        int[] arr = new int[n + 1];
        //the pointer points to position of the arr
        int j = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            if (c == 'D') { //for decrease, we collect numbers in the stack for now
                stack.push(i + 1);
            } else { //for increase, we put all numbers in the stack into the result array
                stack.push(i + 1);
                while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
                    arr[j] = stack.pop();
                    ++j;
                }
            }
        }
        
        //there are still some numbers not handled
        stack.push(n + 1);
        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            arr[j] = stack.pop();
            ++j;
        }
        
        return arr;
    }
}

## Notes
The smallst permutation of given numbers is 1, 2, 3, ... n + 1. We looking for a way to transform this permutation into the smallest one that satisfy the given pattern.   
To generate the required arrangement, we can start off with the min permutation. Then, to satisfy the given pattern, we need to reverse only those subsections of the min array which have a D in the pattern at their corresponding positions. And a good tool to help us do this is stack.
