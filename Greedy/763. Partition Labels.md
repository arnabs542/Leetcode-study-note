## Keyword
Greedy

## Problem description
```
A string S of lowercase letters is given. We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

Example 1:
Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.
Note:

S will have length in range [1, 500].
S will consist of lowercase letters ('a' to 'z') only.

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> partitionLabels(String S) {
        //find rightmost index for each letter
        int[] rightMost = new int[26];
        Arrays.fill(rightMost, -1);
        for (int i = 0; i < S.length(); ++i) {
            char c = S.charAt(i);
            rightMost[(c - 'a')] = i; 
        }
        //draw windows out
        List<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        int left = 0;
        int right = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < S.length(); ++i) {
            char c = S.charAt(i);
            right = Math.max(right, rightMost[(c - 'a')]);
            if (right == i) {
                ans.add(right - left + 1);
                left = right + 1;
                ++right;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Greedy\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
We traverse the string first to find the rightmost index for each letter. Then in the second traversal, we greedily try to find the smallest window that contains letters that don't appear anywhere else.
