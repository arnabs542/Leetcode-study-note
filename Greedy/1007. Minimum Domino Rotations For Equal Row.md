## Keyword
Greedy

## Problem description
```
In a row of dominoes, A[i] and B[i] represent the top and bottom halves of the i-th domino.  (A domino is a tile with two numbers from 1 to 6 - one on each half of the tile.)

We may rotate the i-th domino, so that A[i] and B[i] swap values.

Return the minimum number of rotations so that all the values in A are the same, or all the values in B are the same.

If it cannot be done, return -1.

 

Example 1:



Input: A = [2,1,2,4,2,2], B = [5,2,6,2,3,2]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The first figure represents the dominoes as given by A and B: before we do any rotations.
If we rotate the second and fourth dominoes, we can make every value in the top row equal to 2, as indicated by the second figure.
Example 2:

Input: A = [3,5,1,2,3], B = [3,6,3,3,4]
Output: -1
Explanation: 
In this case, it is not possible to rotate the dominoes to make one row of values equal.
 

Note:

1 <= A[i], B[i] <= 6
2 <= A.length == B.length <= 20000
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int minDominoRotations(int[] A, int[] B) {
        //compute the min number of rotation we have to do to match each of the numbers in the first pair
        int top = rotate(A, B, A[0]);
        int bottom = rotate(A, B, B[0]);
        //return the minimum number of rotation or -1 if it's impossible
        return top == -1 ? (bottom == -1 ? -1 : bottom) : top;
    }
    //find out how many rotation we have to do to match a number on each top or bottom
    private int rotate(int[] A, int[] B, int num){
        int rotateTop = 0, rotateBottom = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < A.length; ++i){
            //if the number doesn't exist in a pair
            if (A[i] != num && B[i] != num){
                return -1;
            }
            //if the top number doesn't match the target number, we have to rotate to make the top match
            if (A[i] != num){
                ++rotateTop;
            }
            //same for the bottom
            else if (B[i] != num){
                ++rotateBottom;
            }
        }
        return Math.min(rotateTop, rotateBottom);
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Take the first pair as candidates to align. Then try to align top or bottom to each candidate number. Return the minimum rotations out of 4 possible match.
