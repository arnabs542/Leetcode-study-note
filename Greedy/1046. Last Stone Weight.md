## Keyword
Greedy, Heap

## Problem description
```
We have a collection of stones, each stone has a positive integer weight.

Each turn, we choose the two heaviest stones and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y.  The result of this smash is:

If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;
If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.
At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the weight of this stone (or 0 if there are no stones left.)

 

Example 1:

Input: [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value of last stone.
 

Note:

1 <= stones.length <= 30
1 <= stones[i] <= 1000

## 4/12/2020 Priority queue, greedy algorithm

```java
class Solution {
    public int lastStoneWeight(int[] stones) {
        //use priority queue to sort the stones
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((x, y) -> y - x);
        for(var s : stones) pq.add(s);
        int stone1 = 0, stone2 = 0;
        //process 2 heaviest stones at a time
        while(pq.size() > 1){
            stone1 = pq.poll();
            stone2 = pq.poll();
            if(stone1 != stone2) pq.add(Math.abs(stone1 - stone2));
        }
        return pq.isEmpty() ? 0 : pq.poll();
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(nlogn)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
We can greedily poll 2 heavy stones out of the priority queue every time just like the game rule indicated

## Key points
Corner cases: \
API: PriorityQueue.add(), PriorityQueue.poll()
