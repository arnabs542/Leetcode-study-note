https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/

## Keyword
Greedy, DP

## Problem description
```
Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

 

Example 1:

Input: [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.
Example 2:

Input: [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of intervals non-overlapping.
Example 3:

Input: [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
 

Note:

You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
Intervals like [1,2] and [2,3] have borders "touching" but they don't overlap each other.

```java
class Solution {
    public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
        //sort intervals by starting time
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        //compare each two intervals and pick 1 of them to discard if there's conflict
        int n = intervals.length;
        //edge cases
        if (n <= 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        int[] last = intervals[0];
        int remove = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            //when there's conflict
            if (last[1] > intervals[i][0]) {
                //discard the one with later end point
                if (last[1] > intervals[i][1]) {
                    last = intervals[i];
                }
                ++remove;
            } else {
                last = intervals[i];
            }
        }
        return remove;
    }
}
```

## Notes
Compare each two intervals and pick the one that ends later to discard if there's conflict.

}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n^2) \
Space complexity: O(n) 

## Notes
We use dp array to store the maximum number of valid intervals that can be included in the final list if the intervals upto the ith interval only are considered, including itself.
