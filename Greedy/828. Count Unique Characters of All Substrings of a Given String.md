## Problem description
```
Let's define a function countUniqueChars(s) that returns the number of unique characters on s, for example if s = "LEETCODE" then "L", "T","C","O","D" are the unique characters since they appear only once in s, therefore countUniqueChars(s) = 5.

On this problem given a string s we need to return the sum of countUniqueChars(t) where t is a substring of s. Notice that some substrings can be repeated so on this case you have to count the repeated ones too.

Since the answer can be very large, return the answer modulo 10 ^ 9 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "ABC"
Output: 10
Explanation: All possible substrings are: "A","B","C","AB","BC" and "ABC".
Evey substring is composed with only unique letters.
Sum of lengths of all substring is 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 10
Example 2:

Input: s = "ABA"
Output: 8
Explanation: The same as example 1, except countUniqueChars("ABA") = 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "LEETCODE"
Output: 92
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 10^4
s contain upper-case English letters only.

        int mod = 1000000007;
        int n = s.length();
        
        //get index for each character
        List<Integer>[] index = new ArrayList[26];
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
            index[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            index[s.charAt(i) - 'A'].add(i);
        }
        
        //count the number of times each character appears as unique characters
        int count = 0;
        for (List<Integer> list : index) {
            list.add(0, -1);
            list.add(n);
            for (int i = 1; i < list.size() - 1; ++i) {
                //get left and right bound of the current index
                int left = list.get(i - 1);
                int right = list.get(i + 1);
                int cur = list.get(i);
                count = (count + (cur - left) * (right - cur)) % mod;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Instead of finding all the substrings, we focus on how many times each character can appears as a unique character in theses substrings. We first save all index of each character, then use each character's each index's left and right indexs as bounds to compute how many times it can appear in a substring while not going out of the these bounds.
