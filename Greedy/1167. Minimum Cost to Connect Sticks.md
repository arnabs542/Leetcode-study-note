## LeetCode link(Medium)
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-connect-sticks/

## Keyword
Greedy, Priority Queue

## Problem description
```
You have some sticks with positive integer lengths.

You can connect any two sticks of lengths X and Y into one stick by paying a cost of X + Y.  You perform this action until there is one stick remaining.

Return the minimum cost of connecting all the given sticks into one stick in this way.

 

Example 1:

Input: sticks = [2,4,3]
Output: 14
Example 2:

Input: sticks = [1,8,3,5]
Output: 30
 

Constraints:

1 <= sticks.length <= 10^4
1 <= sticks[i] <= 10^4
```
## 6/4/2020 Greedy + PriorityQueue

```java
class Solution {
    public int connectSticks(int[] sticks) {
        //use priority queue to make sure we always put two smallest sticks together
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
        for (int t : sticks) {
            pq.add(t);
        }
        int cost = 0;
        while (pq.size() > 1) {
            int t1 = pq.poll();
            int t2 = pq.poll();
            cost += t1 + t2;
            pq.add(t1 + t2);
        }
        return cost;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Greedy + PriorityQueue\
Time complexity: O(nlogn)\
Space complexity: O(n) 

## Notes
To minimise the cost, we should always try to combine the two smallest sticks together first because the earlier a stick is combined, the more often its length will factor into the total cost. We can achieve this using priority queue.
