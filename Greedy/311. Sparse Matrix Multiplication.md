## Problem description
```
Given two sparse matrices A and B, return the result of AB.

You may assume that A's column number is equal to B's row number.

Example:

Input:

A = [
  [ 1, 0, 0],
  [-1, 0, 3]
]

B = [
  [ 7, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 1 ]
]

Output:

     |  1 0 0 |   | 7 0 0 |   |  7 0 0 |
AB = | -1 0 3 | x | 0 0 0 | = | -7 0 3 |
                  | 0 0 1 |
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] multiply(int[][] A, int[][] B) {
        int[][] ans = new int[A.length][B[0].length];
        //for each number in matrix A
        for (int i = 0; i < A.length; ++i) {
            for (int k = 0; k < A[0].length; ++k) {
                //only no zero number from A will contribute to final marix
                if (A[i][k] != 0) {
                    for (int j = 0; j < B[0].length; ++j) {
                        ans[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
greedy\
Time complexity: O(m * k * n)\
Space complexity: O(m * n)

## Notes
To take advantage of the fact that the input matrix is sparse, we can change to the for loop structure to compute each number of A matrix's contribution to the final matrix. This will allow us to skip whenever a number in matrix A is 0 ans save a lot of running time. Although the worst case time complexity is not changed, the actual running time is lot less.
