## Keyword
Greedy, Priority Queue

## Problem description
```
Given a char array representing tasks CPU need to do. It contains capital letters A to Z where different letters represent different tasks. Tasks could be done without original order. Each task could be done in one interval. For each interval, CPU could finish one task or just be idle.

However, there is a non-negative cooling interval n that means between two same tasks, there must be at least n intervals that CPU are doing different tasks or just be idle.

You need to return the least number of intervals the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.

 

Example:

Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.
 

Constraints:

The number of tasks is in the range [1, 10000].
The integer n is in the range [0, 100].

```java
class Solution {
    public int leastInterval(char[] tasks, int n) {
        //count number of each task using array
        int[] count = new int[26];
        for (char c : tasks){
            ++count[c - 'A'];
        }
        //use max Priority to sort the task by their counts
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b - a);
        for (int i : count){
            if (i > 0){
                pq.add(i);
            }
        }
        int time = 0;
        //run through all tasks
        while (!pq.isEmpty()){
            //for each interval, always try to run the max count tasks first
            List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
            int i = 0;
            //pull task out but no more than n + 1 task
            while (!pq.isEmpty() && i <= n){
                int curr = pq.poll();
                --curr;
                if (curr > 0){
                    list.add(curr);
                }
                ++time;
                ++i;
            }
            //fill idles
            if (i <= n && list.size() > 0){
                time += n - i + 1;
            }
            //add tasks back to the pq
            for (int task : list){
                pq.add(task);
            }
        }
        return time;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Greedy\
Time complexity: O(n) n times of iterations, priority contains at most 26 letters\
Space complexity: O(1) at most 26 number of letters

## Notes
The best strategy for us is that for each interval time, we always try to work on tasks that have most frequency. We can simulate this strategy with the help of priority queue.

## 5/23/2020 Greedy + Math

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int leastInterval(vector<char>& tasks, int n) {
        vector<int> count(26, 0);        
        for (const char task : tasks) 
            ++count[task - 'A'];
        const int max_count = *max_element(count.begin(), count.end());
        size_t ans = (max_count - 1) * (n + 1);
        ans += count_if(count.begin(), count.end(),
                        [max_count](int c){ return c == max_count; });
        return max(tasks.size(), ans);
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analyze
Greedy\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
In this approach, we put the most frequent letter as close to each other as possible, forming many empty slots in between where we can insert other tasks freely. And the tasks that have same frequency as the most frequent one would have an extra run after the most frequent letter task has finished. Thus the total step is (k - 1) * (n + 1) + p where k is the largest frequency, n + 1 is the total empty slots for each cycle, and p is number of most frequent tasks. However, if we have more total task than this approach's result, it means we don't need any idle cycle, thus no empty slots, thus we can use the number of task directly as answer since we can always find a strategy to arrange all tasks without idle.
