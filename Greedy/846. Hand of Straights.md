## Keyword
Greedy, TreeMap

## Problem description
```
Alice has a hand of cards, given as an array of integers.

Now she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is size W, and consists of W consecutive cards.

Return true if and only if she can.

 

Example 1:

Input: hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], W = 3
Output: true
Explanation: Alice's hand can be rearranged as [1,2,3],[2,3,4],[6,7,8].
Example 2:

Input: hand = [1,2,3,4,5], W = 4
Output: false
Explanation: Alice's hand can't be rearranged into groups of 4.
 

Constraints:

1 <= hand.length <= 10000
0 <= hand[i] <= 10^9
1 <= W <= hand.length

## 6/17/2020 TreeMap, Greedy

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isNStraightHand(int[] hand, int W) {
        //validate the size
        int n = hand.length;
        if (n % W != 0) {
            return false;
        }
        //use tree map to store all cards and their counts
        TreeMap<Integer, Integer> tree = new TreeMap<>();
        for (int i : hand) {
            tree.put(i, tree.getOrDefault(i, 0) + 1);
        }
        //try to arrange cards from the smallest
        while (!tree.isEmpty()) {
            //smallest card and count
            int base = tree.firstKey();
            int count = tree.get(base);
            //move cards
            for (int i = 0; i < W; ++i) {
                int next = base + i;
                //not enough cards
                if (!tree.containsKey(next) || tree.get(next) < count) {
                    return false;
                } else if (tree.get(next) == count) { //remove counts accordingly
                    tree.remove(next);
                } else {
                    tree.put(next, tree.get(next) - count);
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}

## Complexity Analyze
TreeMap\
Time complexity: O(nlogn)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
We can count each number in a sorted manner, then try to pull W consecutive numbers a time from the smallest number. Once we fail, we can safely say it's impossible to arrange the cards
## Key points
Corner cases: \
API: TreeMap().firstKey()
