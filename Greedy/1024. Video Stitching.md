## Problem description
```
You are given a series of video clips from a sporting event that lasted T seconds.  These video clips can be overlapping with each other and have varied lengths.

Each video clip clips[i] is an interval: it starts at time clips[i][0] and ends at time clips[i][1].  We can cut these clips into segments freely: for example, a clip [0, 7] can be cut into segments [0, 1] + [1, 3] + [3, 7].

Return the minimum number of clips needed so that we can cut the clips into segments that cover the entire sporting event ([0, T]).  If the task is impossible, return -1.

 

Example 1:

Input: clips = [[0,2],[4,6],[8,10],[1,9],[1,5],[5,9]], T = 10
Output: 3
Explanation: 
We take the clips [0,2], [8,10], [1,9]; a total of 3 clips.
Then, we can reconstruct the sporting event as follows:
We cut [1,9] into segments [1,2] + [2,8] + [8,9].
Now we have segments [0,2] + [2,8] + [8,10] which cover the sporting event [0, 10].
Example 2:

Input: clips = [[0,1],[1,2]], T = 5
Output: -1
Explanation: 
We can't cover [0,5] with only [0,1] and [0,2].
Example 3:

Input: clips = [[0,1],[6,8],[0,2],[5,6],[0,4],[0,3],[6,7],[1,3],[4,7],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6],[3,4],[4,5],[5,7],[6,9]], T = 9
Output: 3
Explanation: 
We can take clips [0,4], [4,7], and [6,9].
Example 4:

Input: clips = [[0,4],[2,8]], T = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Notice you can have extra video after the event ends.
 

Note:

1 <= clips.length <= 100
0 <= clips[i][0], clips[i][1] <= 100
0 <= T <= 100
```
## 5/12/2020 Greedy

```java
class Solution {
    public int videoStitching(int[][] clips, int T) {
        //sort all the clips by starting time
        Arrays.sort(clips, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        int count = 0;
        //iterate through all clips until we cover the entire event
        for (int i = 0, st = 0, end = 0; st < T; st = end, ++count){
            //interate through all clips that start not after the current covered time's end
            for (; i < clips.length && clips[i][0] <= st; ++i){
                //try to cover as far as possible
                end = Math.max(end, clips[i][1]);
            }
            //if no clips can bring the covered time further, we have a gap that cannot be covered
            if (st == end){
                return -1;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Greedy\
Time complexity: O(nlogn)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
We sort the input array by starting time first so we don't visit the same clip twice. Then we iterate through these clips and count least clips needed. For each clip that starts before the current covered time, we try to extend the end time as far as possible.

## 5/12/2020 DP Bottom-Up

```java
class Solution {
    public int videoStitching(int[][] clips, int T) {
        int INF = 101;
        //use dp array to store min clips needed to cover time [i, j] with first n clips to choose from
        int[][] dp = new int[T + 1][T + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i <= T; ++i){
            for (int j = 0; j <= T; ++j){
                dp[i][j] = i < j ? INF : 0;
            }
        }
        //in every loop, add 1 clip into the clip pool to choose from
        for (var clip : clips){
            int s = Math.min(clip[0], T);
            int e = Math.min(clip[1], T);
            //for every possible clilp length
            for (int len = 1; len <= T; ++len){
                //for every possible start and end time
                for (int i = 0, j = len; j <= T; ++i, ++j){
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], dp[i][s] + 1 + dp[e][j]);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[0][T] == INF ? -1 : dp[0][T];
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
DP Bottom-Up\
Time complexity: O(n * T^2)\
Space complexity: O(T^2)

## Notes
Use dp array to store min clips needed to cover time [i, j] with first n clips to choose from. Then we add 1 clip into the clip tool to choose from in every outer loop. Note we can cover all corner cases by assining impossible clips value of 0.
