## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n ^ 2)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
We can use hashmap to store slope as irreducible fraction(to avoid precision problem) and correspoinding number of 2nd point for a picked 1st point. Then we try to use every point as the first point, and all points after first point as the second point to get statistics of points on the same line. Note we can utilize gcd to get irreducible fraciton to represent a slope. Also, we need to handle horizontal and vertical line differently. Also notice when counting duplicated points of the 1st point, the point itself also counts as 1 duplicated point.
