## Problem description
```
Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

Example 1:

Input: 121
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Follow up:

Coud you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        //edge case
        if (x < 0) {
            return false;
        }
        int copy = x;
        
        //reverse the number, use long to prevent overflow
        long revertNum = 0;
        while (x > 0) {
            revertNum = revertNum * 10 + x % 10;
            x /= 10;
        }
        
        return (long)copy == revertNum;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(logn)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Reverse the number and compare. Note all negative numbers are not palindrome
