## Problem description
```
Given a rows x cols screen and a sentence represented by a list of non-empty words, find how many times the given sentence can be fitted on the screen.

Note:

A word cannot be split into two lines.
The order of words in the sentence must remain unchanged.
Two consecutive words in a line must be separated by a single space.
Total words in the sentence won't exceed 100.
Length of each word is greater than 0 and won't exceed 10.
1 ≤ rows, cols ≤ 20,000.
Example 1:

Input:
rows = 2, cols = 8, sentence = ["hello", "world"]

Output: 
1

Explanation:
hello---
world---

The character '-' signifies an empty space on the screen.
Example 2:

Input:
rows = 3, cols = 6, sentence = ["a", "bcd", "e"]

Output: 
2

Explanation:
a-bcd- 
e-a---
bcd-e-

The character '-' signifies an empty space on the screen.
Example 3:

Input:
rows = 4, cols = 5, sentence = ["I", "had", "apple", "pie"]

Output: 
1

Explanation:
I-had
apple
pie-I
had--

The character '-' signifies an empty space on the screen.

```java
class Solution {
    public int wordsTyping(String[] sentence, int rows, int cols) {
        //reform the sentence to be a long string with space between each word and a space in the end
        String s = String.join(" ", sentence) + " ";
        int index = 0;
        int n = s.length();
        //iterate through all the rows
        for (int row = 0; row < rows; ++row) {
            //fit cols number of characters in the current row
            index += cols;
            //remove some characters in the end so no word is cut in half
            while (index >= 0 && s.charAt(index % n) != ' ') {
                --index;
            }
            //increament the index to point to the start of next word for the next row
            ++index;
        }
        //total number of sentences that are fitted depends on the current location of index
        return index / n;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(row + L)\
Space complexity: O(L)

## Notes
The idea to solve this problem is to make a infinite sentence stream and use a pointer to keep track of total number index we have interated through. For each row, we first try to fit cols number of characters, then check backward to see if we have to remove a few characters so there's no character cut in half. In the end, we can acquire the number of sentences fitted in the screen by using the total number onf index interated.
