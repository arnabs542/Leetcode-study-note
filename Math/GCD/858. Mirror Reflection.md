## Problem description
```
There is a special square room with mirrors on each of the four walls.  Except for the southwest corner, there are receptors on each of the remaining corners, numbered 0, 1, and 2.

The square room has walls of length p, and a laser ray from the southwest corner first meets the east wall at a distance q from the 0th receptor.

Return the number of the receptor that the ray meets first.  (It is guaranteed that the ray will meet a receptor eventually.)

 

Example 1:

Input: p = 2, q = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The ray meets receptor 2 the first time it gets reflected back to the left wall.

Note:

1 <= p <= 1000
0 <= q <= p

```java
class Solution {
    public int mirrorReflection(int p, int q) {
        //get least common multiple
        int lcm = p * q / gcd(p, q);
        
        int horizontal = lcm / q;
        int vertical = lcm / p;
        
        horizontal %= 2;
        vertical %= 2;
        
        return horizontal == 0 ? 2 : (vertical == 0 ? 0 : 1);
    }
    
    private int gcd(int a, int b) {
        return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(lognP)  
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
We use expand the mirror room as big as we need. Then laser hit point will be at the point where p and q have their least common multiple. So we can compute the LCM first using GCD, then compute which mirror will be at the destination.
