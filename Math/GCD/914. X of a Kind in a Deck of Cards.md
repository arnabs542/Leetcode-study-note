## Keyword
Greedy, Greatest Common Divisor

## Problem description
```
In a deck of cards, each card has an integer written on it.

Return true if and only if you can choose X >= 2 such that it is possible to split the entire deck into 1 or more groups of cards, where:

Each group has exactly X cards.
All the cards in each group have the same integer.
 

Example 1:

Input: deck = [1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1]
Output: true
Explanation: Possible partition [1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4].
Example 2:

Input: deck = [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]
Output: falseÂ´
Explanation: No possible partition.
Example 3:

Input: deck = [1]
Output: false
Explanation: No possible partition.
Example 4:

Input: deck = [1,1]
Output: true
Explanation: Possible partition [1,1].
Example 5:

Input: deck = [1,1,2,2,2,2]
Output: true
Explanation: Possible partition [1,1],[2,2],[2,2].
 

Constraints:

1 <= deck.length <= 10^4
0 <= deck[i] < 10^4
```
## 5/26/2020 greatest common divisor

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean hasGroupsSizeX(int[] deck) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> count = new HashMap<>();
        int res = 0;
        //count numbers of each card
        for (int i : deck) count.put(i, count.getOrDefault(i, 0) + 1);
        //find the greatest common divisor
        for (int i : count.values()) res = gcd(i, res);
        //the GCD needs to be more than 1
        return res > 1;
    }
    //use recursion to find gcd between 2 numbers
    public int gcd(int a, int b) {
        return b > 0 ? gcd(b, a % b) : a;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n * (logn)^2) each gcd operation is naively O(log^2 * Ci)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
The problem comes down to find the greatest common divisor of all counts of cards. And the greatest common divisor needs to be more than 1.
