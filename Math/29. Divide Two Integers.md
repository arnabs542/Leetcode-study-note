## Problem description
```
Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using multiplication, division and mod operator.

Return the quotient after dividing dividend by divisor.

The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, truncate(8.345) = 8 and truncate(-2.7335) = -2.

Example 1:

Input: dividend = 10, divisor = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 10/3 = truncate(3.33333..) = 3.
Example 2:

Input: dividend = 7, divisor = -3
Output: -2
Explanation: 7/-3 = truncate(-2.33333..) = -2.
Note:

Both dividend and divisor will be 32-bit signed integers.
The divisor will never be 0.
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 231 − 1 when the division result overflows.

```java
class Solution {
    public int divide(int dividend, int divisor) {
        // 0 dividend
        if (dividend == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        //if the output might overflow
        if (dividend == Integer.MIN_VALUE && divisor == -1) {
            return Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        }
        // determine sign
        int sign = 1;
        if ((dividend > 0 && divisor < 0) || (dividend < 0 && divisor > 0)) {
            sign = -1;
        }
        //clear sign of original input, use negative numbers as base because there's 1 more negative numbers than positive numbers
        dividend = -(int)Math.abs(dividend);
        divisor = -(int) Math.abs(divisor);
        //compute quotient
        int quotient = 0;
        while (dividend <= divisor) {
            dividend -= divisor;
            --quotient;
        }
        return sign < 0 ? quotient : -quotient;
    }
}

substraction\
Time complexity: O(n) n is the input number\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
This is a naive way to solve the problem. There's 1 possible overflow problem we have to deal with since there's 1 more negative number than possitive number. Also, we should use negative numbers as bases for both dividend and divisor to avoid overflow.
