## Problem description
```
Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using multiplication, division and mod operator.

Return the quotient after dividing dividend by divisor.

The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, truncate(8.345) = 8 and truncate(-2.7335) = -2.

Example 1:

Input: dividend = 10, divisor = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 10/3 = truncate(3.33333..) = 3.
Example 2:

Input: dividend = 7, divisor = -3
Output: -2
Explanation: 7/-3 = truncate(-2.33333..) = -2.
Note:

Both dividend and divisor will be 32-bit signed integers.
The divisor will never be 0.
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 231 − 1 when the division result overflows.

## Notes
This is a naive way to solve the problem. There's 1 possible overflow problem we have to deal with since there's 1 more negative number than possitive number. Also, we should use negative numbers as bases for both dividend and divisor to avoid overflow.

## Notes
Like the last solution, we fit as much as possible by multiplying power of two to the divisor. But this time we save all the intermediate results. Once we are at the largest divisor number, we backtrack to fit smaller results until we run out of numbers. We are basically trading space for time here.
