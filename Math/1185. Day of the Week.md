## Problem description
```
Given a date, return the corresponding day of the week for that date.

The input is given as three integers representing the day, month and year respectively.

Return the answer as one of the following values {"Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"}.

 

Example 1:

Input: day = 31, month = 8, year = 2019
Output: "Saturday"
Example 2:

Input: day = 18, month = 7, year = 1999
Output: "Sunday"
Example 3:

Input: day = 15, month = 8, year = 1993
Output: "Sunday"
 

Constraints:

The given dates are valid dates between the years 1971 and 2100.

        months = new int[] {-1, 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31};
        int daysTarget = days(day, month, year);
        int daysToday = days(6, 8, 2020);
        int weekToday = 4;
        int diff = (daysTarget - daysToday + weekToday) % 7;
        if (diff < 0) {
            diff += 7;
        }
        return week[diff];
    }
    
    private boolean isLeap(int year) {
        return year % 400 == 0 || (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0);
    }
    
    private int days(int day, int month, int year) {
        int days = 0;
        //for years
        for (int i = 1971; i < year; ++i) {
            if (isLeap(i)) {
                days += 366;
            } else {
                days += 365;
            }
        }
        //for month
        for (int i = 1; i < month; ++i) {
            days += months[i];
            if (isLeap(year) && i == 2) {
                ++days;
            }
        }
        //for days
        days += day;
        return days;
    }
}

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(1)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Compute target date and today's date difference by computing their distances to 1970. Then use today's week date to compute the target date's week date.
