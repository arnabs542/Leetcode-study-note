## Problem description
```
Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there is a number N on the chalkboard.  On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of:

Choosing any x with 0 < x < N and N % x == 0.
Replacing the number N on the chalkboard with N - x.
Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.

Return True if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.

 

Example 1:

Input: 2
Output: true
Explanation: Alice chooses 1, and Bob has no more moves.
Example 2:

Input: 3
Output: false
Explanation: Alice chooses 1, Bob chooses 1, and Alice has no more moves.
 

Note:

1 <= N <= 1000

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean divisorGame(int N) {
        //given a odd number, the result must be even
        //given an even number, the player can always make the result odd
        //number 1(odd) will make the player lose the game
        //so anyone starts with even number will win the game
        return N % 2 == 0;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n ^ 2)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Given a odd number, the result must be even; Given an even number, the player can always make the result odd. Number 1(odd) will make the player lose the game. So anyone starts with even number will win the game
