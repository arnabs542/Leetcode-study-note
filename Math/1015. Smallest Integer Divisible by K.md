## Keyword
Long division

## Problem description
```
Given a positive integer K, you need to find the length of the smallest positive integer N such that N is divisible by K, and N only contains the digit 1.

Return the length of N. If there is no such N, return -1.

Note: N may not fit in a 64-bit signed integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: K = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest answer is N = 1, which has length 1.
Example 2:

Input: K = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no such positive integer N divisible by 2.
Example 3:

Input: K = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The smallest answer is N = 111, which has length 3.
 

Constraints:

1 <= K <= 105
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int smallestRepunitDivByK(int K) {
        int remainder = 0;
        for (int length_N = 1; length_N <= K; length_N++) {
            remainder = (remainder * 10 + 1) % K;
            if (remainder == 0) {
                return length_N;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(K)  
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Do the long division until the remainder is zero. Based on the Pigeonhole Principle, since there are at most K different remainders, if we still haven't found the result after K divisions, then there must be repeating remainder(s), therefore the result is impossible. Note we can also use hashset to achieve the repeat check.
