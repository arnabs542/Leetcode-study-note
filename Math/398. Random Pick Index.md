## Keyword
Reservoir sampling

## Problem description
```
Given an array of integers with possible duplicates, randomly output the index of a given target number. You can assume that the given target number must exist in the array.

Note:
The array size can be very large. Solution that uses too much extra space will not pass the judge.

Example:

int[] nums = new int[] {1,2,3,3,3};
Solution solution = new Solution(nums);

// pick(3) should return either index 2, 3, or 4 randomly. Each index should have equal probability of returning.
solution.pick(3);

// pick(1) should return 0. Since in the array only nums[0] is equal to 1.
solution.pick(1);
```

```java
class Solution {
    int[] nums;
    Random random;
    public Solution(int[] nums) {
        this.nums = nums;
        random = new Random();
    }
    
    public int pick(int target) {
        int index = -1;
        //total count of target number
        int count = 0;
        //iterate through inputs
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            //use reservoir sampling, change to the xth index at the chance of 1/x 
            if (nums[i] == target && random.nextInt(++count) == 0) {
                index = i;
            }
        }
        return index;
    }
}

/**
 * Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * Solution obj = new Solution(nums);
 * int param_1 = obj.pick(target);

## Complexity Analyze
Reservoir sampling\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Reservoir sampling can be used to do even chance random pick amount inputs with unknown size. In this problem, since we cannot use extra space, we can use reservoir sampling to achieve O(1) space.
