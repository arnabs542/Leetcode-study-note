## Problem description
```
Given two numbers, hour and minutes. Return the smaller angle (in degrees) formed between the hour and the minute hand.

 

Example 1:



Input: hour = 12, minutes = 30
Output: 165
Example 2:



Input: hour = 3, minutes = 30
Output: 75
Example 3:



Input: hour = 3, minutes = 15
Output: 7.5
Example 4:

Input: hour = 4, minutes = 50
Output: 155
Example 5:

Input: hour = 12, minutes = 0
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

1 <= hour <= 12
0 <= minutes <= 59
Answers within 10^-5 of the actual value will be accepted as correct.

```java
class Solution {
    public double angleClock(int hour, int minutes) {
        double h = (double) hour;
        double m = (double) minutes;
        double mDeg = (6 * m) % 360;
        double hDeg = (m / 2 + 30 * h) % 360;
        double diff = Math.abs(mDeg - hDeg);
        return diff > 180 ? 360 - diff : diff;
    }
}
