## Problem description
```
Find the total area covered by two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane.

Each rectangle is defined by its bottom left corner and top right corner as shown in the figure.

Rectangle Area

Example:

Input: A = -3, B = 0, C = 3, D = 4, E = 0, F = -1, G = 9, H = 2
Output: 45
Note:

Assume that the total area is never beyond the maximum possible value of int.

```java
class Solution {
    public int computeArea(int A, int B, int C, int D, int E, int F, int G, int H) {
        //compute the sum of two rectangle's area
        int sum = (C - A) * (D - B) + (H - F) * (G - E);
        //compute the overlapped area
        int over = 0;
        int left = Math.max(A, E);
        int right = Math.min(C, G);
        int top = Math.min(D, H);
        int bottom = Math.max(B, F);
        if (left < right && top > bottom) {
            over = (right - left) * (top - bottom);
        }
        //total area is sum - overlap
        return sum - over;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n ^ 2)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Total = Sum of Two - Overlap
