## Problem description
```
You have an inventory of different colored balls, and there is a customer that wants orders balls of any color.

The customer weirdly values the colored balls. Each colored ball's value is the number of balls of that color you currently have in your inventory. For example, if you own 6 yellow balls, the customer would pay 6 for the first yellow ball. After the transaction, there are only 5 yellow balls left, so the next yellow ball is then valued at 5 (i.e., the value of the balls decreases as you sell more to the customer).

You are given an integer array, inventory, where inventory[i] represents the number of balls of the ith color that you initially own. You are also given an integer orders, which represents the total number of balls that the customer wants. You can sell the balls in any order.

Return the maximum total value that you can attain after selling orders colored balls. As the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:


Input: inventory = [2,5], orders = 4
Output: 14
Explanation: Sell the 1st color 1 time (2) and the 2nd color 3 times (5 + 4 + 3).
The maximum total value is 2 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 14.
Example 2:

Input: inventory = [3,5], orders = 6
Output: 19
Explanation: Sell the 1st color 2 times (3 + 2) and the 2nd color 4 times (5 + 4 + 3 + 2).
The maximum total value is 3 + 2 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 19.
Example 3:

Input: inventory = [2,8,4,10,6], orders = 20
Output: 110
Example 4:

Input: inventory = [1000000000], orders = 1000000000
Output: 21
Explanation: Sell the 1st color 1000000000 times for a total value of 500000000500000000. 500000000500000000 modulo 109 + 7 = 21.
 

Constraints:

1 <= inventory.length <= 105
1 <= inventory[i] <= 109
1 <= orders <= min(sum(inventory[i]), 109)

## 11/08/2020 PriorityQueue
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] inventory, int orders) {
        PriorityQueue<Long> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        
        for (int i : inventory) {
            pq.add((long)i);
        }
        
        long total = 0;
        
        long curNum = pq.peek();
        long curCount = 0;
        while (orders > 0) {
            //get number of current number ball
            while (!pq.isEmpty() && pq.peek() == curNum) {
                ++curCount;
                pq.poll();
            }
            
            long nextNum = pq.isEmpty() ? 0 : pq.peek();
            
            if (orders >= (curNum - nextNum) * curCount) {
                total += (nextNum + 1 + curNum) * (curNum - nextNum) / 2 * curCount;
                orders -= (curNum - nextNum) * curCount;
            } else {
                long num = orders / curCount;
                total += (curNum - num + 1 + curNum) * num / 2 * curCount;
                
                //what's left
                orders %= curCount;
                total += orders * (curNum - num);
                orders = 0;
            }
            curNum = nextNum;
            total %= 1000000007;
        }
        
        return (int)total;
    }
}

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(nlogn)  
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
This is a typical greedy problem that can be solved by always taking the largest number first. However, since the data size and scale is too large, simulation cost too much time. For each gap between two numbers, we have to use math to get the result in O(1).

## 11/08/2020 Sorting
```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] inventory, int orders) {
        Arrays.sort(inventory);
        long ans = 0;
        int n = inventory.length - 1;
        long count = 1;
        while (orders > 0) {
            if (n > 0 && inventory[n] - inventory[n - 1] > 0 && orders >= count * (inventory[n] - inventory[n - 1])) {
                ans += count * ((inventory[n] * (long) (inventory[n] + 1)) / 2
                        - (inventory[n - 1] * (long) (inventory[n - 1] + 1)) / 2);
                orders -= count * (inventory[n] - inventory[n - 1]);
            } else if (n == 0 || inventory[n] - inventory[n - 1] > 0) {
                long a = orders / count;
                ans += count * ((inventory[n] * (long) (inventory[n] + 1)) / 2
                        - ((inventory[n] - a) * (long) (inventory[n] - a + 1)) / 2);
                long b = orders % count;
                ans += b * (inventory[n] - a);
                orders = 0;
            }
            ans %= 1000000007;
            n--;
            count++;
        }
        return (int) ans;
    }
}

## Notes
Same idea, but we can sort first, then iterate through the list.
