## Keyword
Math, DP

## Problem description
```
Count the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative number, n.

Example:

Input: 10
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 prime numbers less than 10, they are 2, 3, 5, 7.
```

```java
public class Solution {
    public int countPrimes(int n) {
        boolean[] notPrime = new boolean[n];
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            if (notPrime[i] == false) {
                count++;
                for (int j = 2; i*j < n; j++) {
                    notPrime[i*j] = true;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(nlogn))\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Use DP array to update all numbers that are not prime. Note in the outter loop, when we encounter a new number and it's false, then it has to be a prime number because all numbers smaller than it cannot be its factor.

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(nlogn))\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Updated version where the inner loop j starts at i. However, we need to be careful because i * j here might overflow, so we need to use long type to hold them.
