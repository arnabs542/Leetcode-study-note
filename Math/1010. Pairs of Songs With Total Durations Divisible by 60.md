## Problem description
```
In a list of songs, the i-th song has a duration of time[i] seconds. 

Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by 60.  Formally, we want the number of indices i, j such that i < j with (time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: [30,20,150,100,40]
Output: 3
Explanation: Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60:
(time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180
(time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120
(time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60
Example 2:

Input: [60,60,60]
Output: 3
Explanation: All three pairs have a total duration of 120, which is divisible by 60.
 

Note:

1 <= time.length <= 60000
1 <= time[i] <= 500

```java
class Solution {
    public int numPairsDivisibleBy60(int[] time) {
        //collect all remainder of each song into groups
        int[] remainderGroup = new int[60];
        for (int i : time) {
            ++remainderGroup[i % 60];
        }
        //compute number of pairs
        int pairs = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= 29; ++i) {
            pairs += remainderGroup[i] * remainderGroup[60 - i];
        }
        //for 0 and 30 remainder group
        pairs += remainderGroup[0] * (remainderGroup[0] - 1) / 2;
        pairs += remainderGroup[30] * (remainderGroup[30] - 1) / 2;
        return pairs;
    }
}
```

## 7/26/2020 Community Count each pair

```java
class Solution {
    public int numPairsDivisibleBy60(int[] time) {
        int c[]  = new int[60], res = 0;
        for (int t : time) {
            res += c[(600 - t) % 60];
            c[t % 60] += 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
For each new coming time's remainder, we just need to count all exisitng valid combination that can make 60 with it. It's like two sum
