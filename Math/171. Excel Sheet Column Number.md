## Keyword
Math, Base convertion

## Problem description
```
Given a column title as appear in an Excel sheet, return its corresponding column number.

For example:

    A -> 1
    B -> 2
    C -> 3
    ...
    Z -> 26
    AA -> 27
    AB -> 28 
    ...
Example 1:

Input: "A"
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: "AB"
Output: 28
Example 3:

Input: "ZY"
Output: 701
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 7
s consists only of uppercase English letters.
s is between "A" and "FXSHRXW".

## 7/7/2020 Base convertion

```java
class Solution {
    public int titleToNumber(String s) {
        int ans = 0;
        //left to right conversion
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i) {
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            ans *= 26;
            //plus one here because the number system has no '0'
            ans += (int)(c - 'A') + 1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
This number system has no "0" digit, so at each conversion we need to plus 1.
