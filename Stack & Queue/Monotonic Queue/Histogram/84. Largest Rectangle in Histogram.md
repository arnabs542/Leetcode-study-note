## Keyword
Array, stack

## Problem description
```
Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.

 


Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3].

 


The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.

 

Example:

Input: [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10

    public int largestRectangleArea(int[] heights) {
        //use stack to keep track of histograms
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        //add index -1 as the left bound
        stack.push(-1);
        int size = 0;
        int n = heights.length;
        //interate through all the histogram
        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i){
            //if the new histogram is equal or lower than the current top, extract a rectangle formed by the top index's height and the width difference between the second top index and the new histogram
            while(stack.size() > 1 && heights[stack.peek()] >= heights[i]){
                size = Math.max(size, heights[stack.pop()] * (i - 1 - stack.peek()));
            }
            stack.push(i);
        }
        //run the same popping algorithm on all the remaining histograms
        while(stack.size() > 1){
            size = Math.max(size, heights[stack.pop()] * (n - 1 - stack.peek()));
        }
        return size;
    }

## Notes
We can use stack to keep track of histogram indeces. Everytime a new histogram comes in, if it is equal or lower than the current top, extract a rectangle formed by the top index's height and the width difference between the second top index and the new histogram. At the end, we can use the same algorithm to clean up the remaining histograms in the stack. Note that by using this algorithm, we compute rectangles that use certain histogram height only at its widest possible width thus avoiding a lot of calculation of smaller retangles. Note we have to keep -1 in the stack as the absolute left bond.
