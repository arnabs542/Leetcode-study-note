## Keyword
Stack, Monotonic Queue

## Problem description
```
Given a list of daily temperatures T, return a list such that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put 0 instead.

For example, given the list of temperatures T = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73], your output should be [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0].

Note: The length of temperatures will be in the range [1, 30000]. Each temperature will be an integer in the range [30, 100].

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] dailyTemperatures(int[] T) {
        int n = T.length;
        int[] daysWarmer = new int[n];
        
        //use stack to keep index and find the closet days that the new day is warmer than
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (stack.isEmpty() || T[stack.peek()] >= T[i]) { //push new temperatures into the stack
                stack.push(i);
            } else {
                while (!stack.isEmpty() && T[stack.peek()] < T[i]) {
                    int prev = stack.pop();
                    daysWarmer[prev] = i - prev;
                }
                stack.push(i);
            }
        }
        
        return daysWarmer;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(1) for all operations\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Use stack(monotonic queue) to find the nearst value in the array that's larger than the current one.

API: Stack.push(), Stack.pop(), Stack.peek()
