## Keyword
Deque

## Problem description
```
Given an array of integers nums and an integer limit, return the size of the longest non-empty subarray such that the absolute difference between any two elements of this subarray is less than or equal to limit.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [8,2,4,7], limit = 4
Output: 2 
Explanation: All subarrays are: 
[8] with maximum absolute diff |8-8| = 0 <= 4.
[8,2] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4. 
[8,2,4] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
[8,2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
[2] with maximum absolute diff |2-2| = 0 <= 4.
[2,4] with maximum absolute diff |2-4| = 2 <= 4.
[2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |2-7| = 5 > 4.
[4] with maximum absolute diff |4-4| = 0 <= 4.
[4,7] with maximum absolute diff |4-7| = 3 <= 4.
[7] with maximum absolute diff |7-7| = 0 <= 4. 
Therefore, the size of the longest subarray is 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [10,1,2,4,7,2], limit = 5
Output: 4 
Explanation: The subarray [2,4,7,2] is the longest since the maximum absolute diff is |2-7| = 5 <= 5.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [4,2,2,2,4,4,2,2], limit = 0
Output: 3
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
0 <= limit <= 10^9
```

        for (int r = 0, l = 0; r < nums.length; ++r) {
            //add the new element into deques and remove any elements at the front that will have no contribute to max or min
            while (!max.isEmpty() && nums[max.getLast()] <= nums[r]) {
                max.pollLast();
            }
            while (!min.isEmpty() && nums[min.getLast()] >= nums[r]) {
                min.pollLast();
            }
            max.addLast(r);
            min.addLast(r);
            //remove some elements on the left so the current window have a diff less or equal to limit
            while ((nums[max.getFirst()] - nums[min.getFirst()]) > limit) {
                if (max.getFirst() == l) {
                    max.pollFirst();
                }
                if (min.getFirst() == l) {
                    min.pollFirst();
                }
                ++l;
            }
            length = Math.max(length, r - l + 1);
        }
        return length;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
We can use two deques to hold both the max and the min in the current sliding window.
