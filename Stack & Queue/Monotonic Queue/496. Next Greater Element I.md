## Keyword
Monotonic queue, Stack

## Problem description
```
You are given two arrays (without duplicates) nums1 and nums2 where nums1â€™s elements are subset of nums2. Find all the next greater numbers for nums1's elements in the corresponding places of nums2.

The Next Greater Number of a number x in nums1 is the first greater number to its right in nums2. If it does not exist, output -1 for this number.

Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2].
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation:
    For number 4 in the first array, you cannot find the next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
    For number 1 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
    For number 2 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4].
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation:
    For number 2 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
    For number 4 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
Note:
All elements in nums1 and nums2 are unique.
The length of both nums1 and nums2 would not exceed 1000.

## 10/28/2020 Monotonic queue
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] nextGreaterElement(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        //use dp to store next greater number for each number in nums2
        Map<Integer, Integer> dp = new HashMap<>();
        //monotonic queue
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums2.length; ++i) {
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && nums2[stack.peek()] < nums2[i]) {
                dp.put(nums2[stack.pop()], nums2[i]);
            }
            stack.push(i);
        }
        int[] ans = new int[nums1.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < nums1.length; ++i) {
            ans[i] = dp.containsKey(nums1[i]) ? dp.get(nums1[i]) : -1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
We can use monotonic queue to get the next greater number for each number in the original list.
