## Keyword
Stack, DP, monotonic queue

## Problem description
```
Given a sequence of n integers a1, a2, ..., an, a 132 pattern is a subsequence ai, aj, ak such that i < j < k and ai < ak < aj. Design an algorithm that takes a list of n numbers as input and checks whether there is a 132 pattern in the list.

Note: n will be less than 15,000.

Example 1:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]

Output: False

Explanation: There is no 132 pattern in the sequence.
Example 2:
Input: [3, 1, 4, 2]

Output: True

Explanation: There is a 132 pattern in the sequence: [1, 4, 2].
Example 3:
Input: [-1, 3, 2, 0]

Output: True

Explanation: There are three 132 patterns in the sequence: [-1, 3, 2], [-1, 3, 0] and [-1, 2, 0].

        //build the min value dp
        int[] min = new int[n];
        min[0] = nums[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            if (min[i - 1] > nums[i]) {
                min[i] = nums[i];
            } else {
                min[i] = min[i - 1];
            }
        }
        //use stack to search for the 132 pattern
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (nums[i] > min[i]) {
                //pop all numbers in the stack that are too small
                while (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() <= min[i]) {
                    stack.pop();
                }
                if (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() < nums[i]) {
                    return true;
                } else if (stack.isEmpty() || nums[i] < stack.peek()){
                    stack.push(nums[i]);
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Use array to keep minimum number from the left, use stack to keep a strictly decreasing number sets from the right. Then we start interating through the numbers from the right: for each number i, if it is larger than the min number on the left, we need to look into the stack to see if there exists a number s on the right that min < s < i. Basically, we need to maintain the stack that we can always get the smallest number that's greater than min and check if it is valid.
