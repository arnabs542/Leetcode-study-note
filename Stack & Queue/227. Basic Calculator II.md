## Problem description
```
Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.

The expression string contains only non-negative integers, +, -, *, / operators and empty spaces . The integer division should truncate toward zero.

Example 1:

Input: "3+2*2"
Output: 7
Example 2:

Input: " 3/2 "
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: " 3+5 / 2 "
Output: 5
Note:

You may assume that the given expression is always valid.
Do not use the eval built-in library function.

```java
class Solution {
    public int calculate(String s) {
        //add delimiter
        s += '.';
        //use stack to keep uncalculated numbers
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        //initial operator and number holder
        char sign = '+';
        int num = 0;
        //iterate through the expression and solve multiplication and division first
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            //skip space
            if (c == ' ') {
                continue;
            }
            //if we get a number
            if (Character.isDigit(c)) {
                num = num * 10 + (int)(c - '0');
            } else { //if we get a operator, we need to resolve the previous number and operator
                if (sign == '+') {
                    stack.push(num);
                } else if (sign == '-') {
                    stack.push(-num);
                } else if (sign == '*') {
                    stack.push(stack.pop() * num);
                } else {
                    stack.push(stack.pop() / num);
                }
                //reset number and operator
                sign = c;
                num = 0;
            }
        }
        //solve addition and substraction
        int ans = 0;
        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            ans += stack.pop();
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Stack\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Use a stack to keep each local result while solving multiplication and divison along the way. At the end, solve addition and substraction. Note we use delimiter to mark the end of the expression so the last local operation can be calculated.

        return stack.peek();
    }

    
    public int getMin() {
        return minStack.peek()[0];
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Two Stack\
Time complexity: O(1) for all operations\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
In this solution, we potentially can save some space by having a pair of numbers in the extra stack. The first number is the min and the second is how many duplicates the min has in the stack.
