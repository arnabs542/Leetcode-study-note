## Problem description
```
In an exam room, there are N seats in a single row, numbered 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1.

When a student enters the room, they must sit in the seat that maximizes the distance to the closest person.  If there are multiple such seats, they sit in the seat with the lowest number.  (Also, if no one is in the room, then the student sits at seat number 0.)

Return a class ExamRoom(int N) that exposes two functions: ExamRoom.seat() returning an int representing what seat the student sat in, and ExamRoom.leave(int p) representing that the student in seat number p now leaves the room.  It is guaranteed that any calls to ExamRoom.leave(p) have a student sitting in seat p.

 

Example 1:

Input: ["ExamRoom","seat","seat","seat","seat","leave","seat"], [[10],[],[],[],[],[4],[]]
Output: [null,0,9,4,2,null,5]
Explanation:
ExamRoom(10) -> null
seat() -> 0, no one is in the room, then the student sits at seat number 0.
seat() -> 9, the student sits at the last seat number 9.
seat() -> 4, the student sits at the last seat number 4.
seat() -> 2, the student sits at the last seat number 2.
leave(4) -> null
seat() -> 5, the student sits at the last seat number 5.
​​​​​​​

Note:

1 <= N <= 10^9
ExamRoom.seat() and ExamRoom.leave() will be called at most 10^4 times across all test cases.
Calls to ExamRoom.leave(p) are guaranteed to have a student currently sitting in seat number p.

## 4/8/2020 TreeSet

```java
class ExamRoom {
    
    TreeSet<Integer> tree;
    int max;
    int min;
    
    public ExamRoom(int N) {
        tree = new TreeSet<>();
        max = N - 1;
        min = 0;
    }
    
    public int seat() {
        //special case
        if(tree.isEmpty()){
            tree.add(0);
            return 0;
        }
        //interate through the tree to find the max distance seat
        int last = min;
        int curDis, curSeat;
        //left bound case
        curDis = tree.first() - min;
        curSeat = min;
        last = tree.first();
        //iteration
        for(int i : tree){
            //skip the first element
            if(i == tree.first()) continue;
            //if there's a larger distance, we update the seat number
            if((i - last) / 2 > curDis){
                curDis = (i - last) / 2;
                curSeat = (last + i) / 2;
            }
            last = i;
        }
        //right bound case
        if((max - last) > curDis) curSeat = max;
        tree.add(curSeat);
        return curSeat;
    }
    
    public void leave(int p) {
        tree.remove(p);
    }
}

/**
 * Your ExamRoom object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * ExamRoom obj = new ExamRoom(N);
 * int param_1 = obj.seat();
 * obj.leave(p);
 */
```

## Complexity Analyze
two pointer one pass\
Time complexity: Each seat operation is O(P), (where P is the number of students sitting), as we iterate through every student. Each leave operation is O(P) (logP in Java).\
Space complexity: O(P)

## Notes
Whenever a new student comes in, we need to iterate through all the seated seats to determine the biggest distance for the student to pick a seat. So we need a HashSet that is always sorted, which is TreeSet in Java. Note that we need to extra careful with left bound and right bound condition.

## Key points
Corner cases:\
API: TreeSet.add(), TreeSet.remove(), TreeSet.first()
