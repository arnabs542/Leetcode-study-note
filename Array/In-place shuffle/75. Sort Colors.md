## Keyword
Array, Sorting, Two pointers

## Problem description
```
Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

Note: You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

Example:

Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
Follow up:

A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space?

## 3/1/2020 Three pointers

```java
class Solution {
    public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
        //create 3 pointers to point at rightmost of red, leftmost of blue, current position
        int red = 0, blue = nums.length - 1, cur = 0;
        //
        while(cur <= blue){
            if(nums[cur] == 2){
                swap(nums, cur, blue--);
            }
            else if(nums[cur] == 0){
                swap(nums, cur++, red++);
            }
            else cur++;
        }
    }
    private void swap(int[] nums, int a, int b){
        int c = nums[a];
        nums[a] = nums[b];
        nums[b] = c;
    }
}
```

## Notes
Dutch National Flag problem. When using 3 pointers, we need to be careful that the current pointer only moves in 2 out of 3 conditions. In this case, we let current pointer move when the left pointer moves because the current pointer starts from left and it cannot be behind the left pointer.
