## Keyword
Array

## Problem description
```
Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] and k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Example 2:

Input: [-1,-100,3,99] and k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
Note:

Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.
Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?

```java
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        k = k % n;
        int count = 0, n = nums.length;
        if(k == 0) return;
        for(int start = 0; count < n; start++){
            int current = start;
            int prev = nums[current];
            do{
                int next = (current + k) % n;
                int tmp = nums[next];
                nums[next] = prev;
                current = next;
                prev = tmp;
                count++;
            }while(current != start);
        }
        
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
We can directly place every number of the array at its required correct position in one pass by using two temparay variables. The problem is that if k is factor of n, then the cycle will come back to where it started with only n/k elements moved. To solve this problem, we have to keep a total counter to check if we have moved n elements and to move the cycle 1 step if it ever comes back to the start point without hitting n moves.

## Key points
Corner cases: if k % n is 0, then return right away.\

## Community: Using Reverse Java

```java
public class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        k %= nums.length;
        reverse(nums, 0, nums.length - 1);
        reverse(nums, 0, k - 1);
        reverse(nums, k, nums.length - 1);
    }
    public void reverse(int[] nums, int start, int end) {
        while (start < end) {
            int temp = nums[start];
            nums[start] = nums[end];
            nums[end] = temp;
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
This approach is based on the fact that when we rotate the array k times, k%nk elements from the back end of the array come to the front and the rest of the elements from the front shift backwards. In this approach, we firstly reverse all the elements of the array. Then, reversing the first k elements followed by reversing the rest n-knâˆ’k elements gives us the required result.
