## Keyword
Binary Search, Floyd's cycle dectection

## Problem description
```
Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

Example 1:

Input: [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
Note:

You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n2).
There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.

## 2/25/2019 Floyd's cycle detection

```java
class Solution {
    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        //we can use Floyd's Tortoise and Hare cycle detection to find the cycle entrance point
        //enter the cycle and find the intersection point
        int tort = 0, hare = 0;
        do{
            hare = nums[nums[hare]];
            tort = nums[tort];
        } while(hare != tort);
        //find the cycle entrance point
        tort = 0;
        while(hare != tort){
            hare = nums[hare];
            tort = nums[tort];
        }
        return hare;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
one pass\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
This problem is a cycle dection problem when we think of each value is the next pointer to another index in the array because: 1. index 0 always has value that points to some onther index; 2. the repeat values are pointers to the cycle entrance.

## Community: sorting and binary search

```java
class Solution {
    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        //sort the array in place
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        //use binary search to find the repeat value
        int l = 0, r = nums.length - 1;
        while(l < r){
            int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
            //when index is still smaller than the value, the repeats must be on the right side
            if(mid < nums[mid]) l = mid + 1;
            else r = mid;
        }
        return nums[l];
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
one pass\
Time complexity: O(nlogn) + O(logn)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
For a sorted list where 1 <= nums[i] < n, before encountering the repeats, the index must be smaller than the value in the index. We can use this as the base to do binary search.
