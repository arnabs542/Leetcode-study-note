## Problem description
```
Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they would compete for water and both would die.

Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty), and a number n, return if n new flowers can be planted in it without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

Example 1:
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: True
Example 2:
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: False
Note:
The input array won't violate no-adjacent-flowers rule.
The input array size is in the range of [1, 20000].
n is a non-negative integer which won't exceed the input array size.

## 5/27/2020 Computation based on gaps

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canPlaceFlowers(int[] flowerbed, int n) {
        //iterate through the flowerbed and compute total number of new flowers that can be planted
        int last = -2;
        int total = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < flowerbed.length; ++i) {
            //encounter a new flower
            if (flowerbed[i] == 1) {
                total += Math.max(0, (i - last) / 2 - 1);
                last = i;
            }
        }
        total += Math.max(0, (flowerbed.length + 1 - last) / 2 - 1);
        return n <= total;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
For each gap, we count number of flowers that can be planted, then add it to total.

        while (i < flowerbed.length) {

        }
        return count >= n;

Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
For every index, we check both neighbor slots to see if we can plant and new flower.
