## Problem description
```
On a 2 dimensional grid with R rows and C columns, we start at (r0, c0) facing east.

Here, the north-west corner of the grid is at the first row and column, and the south-east corner of the grid is at the last row and column.

Now, we walk in a clockwise spiral shape to visit every position in this grid. 

Whenever we would move outside the boundary of the grid, we continue our walk outside the grid (but may return to the grid boundary later.) 

Eventually, we reach all R * C spaces of the grid.

Return a list of coordinates representing the positions of the grid in the order they were visited.

 

Example 1:

Input: R = 1, C = 4, r0 = 0, c0 = 0
Output: [[0,0],[0,1],[0,2],[0,3]]


 

Example 2:

Input: R = 5, C = 6, r0 = 1, c0 = 4
Output: [[1,4],[1,5],[2,5],[2,4],[2,3],[1,3],[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[3,5],[3,4],[3,3],[3,2],[2,2],[1,2],[0,2],[4,5],[4,4],[4,3],[4,2],[4,1],[3,1],[2,1],[1,1],[0,1],[4,0],[3,0],[2,0],[1,0],[0,0]]


 

Note:

1 <= R <= 100
1 <= C <= 100
0 <= r0 < R
0 <= c0 < C

        List<int[]> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        //directions
        int[] dir = new int[]{0, 1, 0, -1, 0};
        //starting states
        int r = r0, c = c0, direction = 0, visited = 0, step = 0, count = 1;
        //traverse through the matrix
        while(visited < R * C){
            //update answer if inside the matrix
            if(r >= 0 && r < R && c >= 0 && c < C){
                ans.add(new int[]{r, c});
                visited++;
            }
            step++;
            //next position
            r += dir[direction];
            c += dir[direction + 1];
            //change direction, extend step count if applicable
            if(step == count){
                step = 0;
                direction = (direction + 1) % 4;
                if(direction % 2 == 0) count++; 
            }
        }
        return ans.toArray(new int[R * C][]);
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Simulation\
Time complexity: O((max(R, C)) ^ 2)\
Space complexity: O(R * C)

## Notes
We can simulate the spiral traversal by changing travel direction and number of steps to travel in one direction according to the spiral pattern. Everytime we encounter a real number, we add it to the answer list.
