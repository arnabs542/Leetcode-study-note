Array

## Problem description
```
Implement next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.

If such arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it as the lowest possible order (ie, sorted in ascending order).

The replacement must be in-place and use only constant extra memory.

Here are some examples. Inputs are in the left-hand column and its corresponding outputs are in the right-hand column.

1,2,3 → 1,3,2
3,2,1 → 1,2,3
1,1,5 → 1,5,1
```

        int n = nums.length;
        //corner case
        if (n < 2) return;
        //find the first descending point from right to left
        int index = n - 2;
        while (index >= 0 && nums[index] >= nums[index + 1]){
            --index;
        }
        //if the whole array is in descending order from left to right
        if (index < 0){
            Arrays.sort(nums);
        }
        else {
            //swap the next bigger element in the descedning part with the current index number
            int larger = index + 1;
            while (larger < n && nums[larger] > nums[index]){
                ++larger;
            }
            --larger;
            swap(nums, index, larger);
            //reverse the subarray from index + 1
            reverse(nums, index + 1, n - 1);
        }
    }
    private void reverse(int[] nums, int l, int r){
        while (l < r){
            swap(nums, l, r);
            ++l;
            --r;
        }
    }

    private void swap(int[] nums, int a, int b){
        int tmp = nums[a];
        nums[a] = nums[b];

## Notes
We can treat array like a number that has carry system, our goal is to "add 1" to the system. From right to left, we find the first point that the number decreases, then increase this number by the lowest possible amount by swapping it with the next larger number on its right. At this point, the "carry" is done and we can "zeroing" the numbers to the right by sorting the numbers to ascending order. In this case, since these numbers are in descending order, we can just reverse them.
