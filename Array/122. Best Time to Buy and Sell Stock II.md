Array

## Problem description
```
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:

Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Example 2:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
Example 3:

Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

## 10/24/2019 Peak Valley Approach Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int n = prices.length;
        int valley = prices[0];
        int peak = prices[0];
        int max_profit = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n - 1;){
            while(i < n - 1 && prices[i] >= prices[i + 1])
                i++;
            valley = prices[i];
            while(i < n - 1 && prices[i] <= prices[i + 1])
                i++;
            peak = prices[i];
            max_profit += peak - valley;
        }
        return max_profit;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
one pass\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
The problem can be broken down to finding all the valley-peak pair and add all the difference together. Notice that there are a lot of corner cases to be considered in this problem

## Key points
Corner cases: Since we are comparing each element with its next one, the loop condition can only be i < n - 1 and we have to put this condition before the comparison so it it will ends the loop before i + 1 reaches out of range; Another import points to notice is that the assignment logic happens outside the while loop, so even thought the loop ends where i < n - 1, the actual i = n -1 case is still considered outside the loop\

## Community: Simple one pass Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int maxprofit = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1])
                maxprofit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
        }
        return maxprofit;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
one pass\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
 In this case, instead of looking for every peak following a valley, we can simply go on crawling over the slope and keep on adding the profit obtained from every consecutive transaction.

## Key points
Corner cases: since we are comparing i with i - 1, we have to set a base and start with i = 1\
