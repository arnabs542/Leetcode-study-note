## Keyword
Design, Queue, LinkedList

## Problem description
```
Design a hit counter which counts the number of hits received in the past 5 minutes.

Each function accepts a timestamp parameter (in seconds granularity) and you may assume that calls are being made to the system in chronological order (ie, the timestamp is monotonically increasing). You may assume that the earliest timestamp starts at 1.

It is possible that several hits arrive roughly at the same time.

Example:

HitCounter counter = new HitCounter();

// hit at timestamp 1.
counter.hit(1);

// hit at timestamp 2.
counter.hit(2);

// hit at timestamp 3.
counter.hit(3);

// get hits at timestamp 4, should return 3.
counter.getHits(4);

// hit at timestamp 300.
counter.hit(300);

// get hits at timestamp 300, should return 4.
counter.getHits(300);

// get hits at timestamp 301, should return 3.
counter.getHits(301); 
Follow up:
What if the number of hits per second could be very large? Does your design scale?

## 6/10/2020 LinkedList
```java
class HitCounter {
    LinkedList<Pair<Integer, Integer>> list;
    int count;
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public HitCounter() {
        list = new LinkedList<>();
        count = 0;
    }
    
    /** Record a hit.
        @param timestamp - The current timestamp (in seconds granularity). */
    public void hit(int timestamp) {
        //if the hit happens on the same time as another hit
        if (count != 0 && list.getLast().getKey() == timestamp) {
            Pair<Integer, Integer> last = list.pollLast();
            list.addLast(new Pair<>(last.getKey(), last.getValue() + 1));
        } else {
            list.addLast(new Pair<>(timestamp, 1));
        }
        ++count;
    }
    
    /** Return the number of hits in the past 5 minutes.
        @param timestamp - The current timestamp (in seconds granularity). */
    public int getHits(int timestamp) {
        //remove hits too early
        while (count > 0 && list.getFirst().getKey() <= timestamp - 300) {
            Pair<Integer, Integer> first = list.pollFirst();
            count -= first.getValue();
        }
        return count;
    }
}

/**
 * Your HitCounter object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * HitCounter obj = new HitCounter();
 * obj.hit(timestamp);
 * int param_2 = obj.getHits(timestamp);
 */
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Use LinkedList node to store timestamp and number of hits on that timestamp. When we get a getRequest, we need to pop all nodes that are too early.

## 6/10/2020 rotating array
```java
class HitCounter {
    
    int[] count;
    int total;
    int head;
    int tail;
    int time;

    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public HitCounter() {
        //use array to store hit times at each second
        count = new int[300];
        total = 0;
        head = 0;
        tail = 1;
        time = 0;
    }
    
    /** Record a hit.
        @param timestamp - The current timestamp (in seconds granularity). */
    public void hit(int timestamp) {
        rotate(timestamp);
        ++count[head];
        ++total;
    }
    
    /** Return the number of hits in the past 5 minutes.
        @param timestamp - The current timestamp (in seconds granularity). */
    public int getHits(int timestamp) {
        rotate(timestamp);
        return total;
    }
    
    private void rotate(int timestamp) {
        if (timestamp - time > 300) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 300; ++i) {
                count[i] = 0;
            }
            total = 0;
            time = timestamp;
            head = time % 300;
            tail = (time + 1) % 300;
        }
        while (time != timestamp) {
            total -= count[tail];
            count[tail] = 0;
            head = (head + 1) % 300;
            tail = (tail + 1) % 300;
            ++time;
        }
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Since the total time count is only 300 seconds, we can use a rotating array to keep track of hits on each timestamp.
