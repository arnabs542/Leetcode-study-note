## Problem description
```
Given a stream of integers and a window size, calculate the moving average of all integers in the sliding window.

Example:

MovingAverage m = new MovingAverage(3);
m.next(1) = 1
m.next(10) = (1 + 10) / 2
m.next(3) = (1 + 10 + 3) / 3
m.next(5) = (10 + 3 + 5) / 3
```

## 6/17/2020 Queue
```java
class MovingAverage {
    
    Queue<Integer> q;
    double runningTotal;
    int size;
    
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public MovingAverage(int size) {
        q = new LinkedList<>();
        runningTotal = 0;
        this.size = size;
    }
    
    public double next(int val) {
        if (q.size() == size) {
            runningTotal -= (double)q.poll();
        }
        q.add(val);
        runningTotal += val;
        return runningTotal / (double)q.size();
    }
}

/**
 * Your MovingAverage object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MovingAverage obj = new MovingAverage(size);
 * double param_1 = obj.next(val);
 */
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(1)\
Space complexity: O(m) m is the size of the window

## Notes
Use queue to manage the sliding window.

## 6/17/2020 Array
```java
class MovingAverage {
    
    int[] array;
    double runningTotal;
    int total;
    
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public MovingAverage(int size) {
        array = new int[size];
        total = 0;
        runningTotal = 0;
    }
    
    public double next(int val) {
        //update the circular queue and running total
        runningTotal -= (double)array[total % array.length];
        array[total % array.length] = val;
        runningTotal += (double)val;
        ++total;
        return runningTotal / (double)(total < array.length ? total : array.length);
    }
}

/**
 * Your MovingAverage object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MovingAverage obj = new MovingAverage(size);
 * double param_1 = obj.next(val);
 */
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(1)\
Space complexity: O(m) where m is total size of incoming messages

## Notes
We can also use array to implement a circular queue.
