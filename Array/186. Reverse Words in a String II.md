## Keyword
Array

## Problem description
```
Given an input string , reverse the string word by word. 

Example:

Input:  ["t","h","e"," ","s","k","y"," ","i","s"," ","b","l","u","e"]
Output: ["b","l","u","e"," ","i","s"," ","s","k","y"," ","t","h","e"]
Note: 

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
The input string does not contain leading or trailing spaces.
The words are always separated by a single space.
Follow up: Could you do it in-place without allocating extra space?

```java
class Solution {
    public void reverseWords(char[] s) {
        //reverse the entire array
        reverse(s, 0, s.length - 1);
        //reverse each word
        for (int l = 0, r = 0; r < s.length; l = r + 1, ++r) {
            while (r < s.length && s[r] != ' ') {
                ++r;
            }
            reverse(s, l, r - 1);
        }
    }
    private void reverse(char[] s, int l, int r) {
        while (l < r) {
            char temp = s[l];
            s[l] = s[r];
            s[r] = temp;
            ++l;
            --r;
        }
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
We can reverse the entire array, then reverse word by word.
