## Problem description
```
Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

Example:
Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].

Input: word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”
Output: 3
Input: word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"
Output: 1
Note:
You may assume that word1 does not equal to word2, and word1 and word2 are both in the list.

```java
class Solution {
    public int shortestDistance(String[] words, String word1, String word2) {
        int i1 = -1, i2 = -1;
        int minDistance = words.length;
        int currentDistance;
        for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
            if (words[i].equals(word1)) {
                i1 = i;
            } else if (words[i].equals(word2)) {
                i2 = i;
            }

            if (i1 != -1 && i2 != -1) {
                minDistance = Math.min(minDistance, Math.abs(i1 - i2));
            }
        }
        return minDistance;
    }
}

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Everytime we encounter a target string, we try to update the distance based on latest index of both target strings.
