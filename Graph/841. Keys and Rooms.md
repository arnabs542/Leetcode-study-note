## Problem description
```
There are N rooms and you start in room 0.  Each room has a distinct number in 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1, and each room may have some keys to access the next room. 

Formally, each room i has a list of keys rooms[i], and each key rooms[i][j] is an integer in [0, 1, ..., N-1] where N = rooms.length.  A key rooms[i][j] = v opens the room with number v.

Initially, all the rooms start locked (except for room 0). 

You can walk back and forth between rooms freely.

Return true if and only if you can enter every room.

Example 1:

Input: [[1],[2],[3],[]]
Output: true
Explanation:  
We start in room 0, and pick up key 1.
We then go to room 1, and pick up key 2.
We then go to room 2, and pick up key 3.
We then go to room 3.  Since we were able to go to every room, we return true.
Example 2:

Input: [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]
Output: false
Explanation: We can't enter the room with number 2.
Note:

1 <= rooms.length <= 1000
0 <= rooms[i].length <= 1000
The number of keys in all rooms combined is at most 3000.

## 3/6/2020 DFS with recursion

```java
class Solution {
    //use a hash table to store room visited
    Set<Integer> visited = new HashSet<>();
    public boolean canVisitAllRooms(List<List<Integer>> rooms) {
        //start from room 0, dfs to enter more rooms
        dfs(rooms, 0);
        //check how many rooms are visited
        return visited.size() == rooms.size() ? true : false;
    }
    public void dfs(List<List<Integer>> rooms, int cur){
        if(visited.contains(cur)){
            return;
        }
        //mark current room as visited
        visited.add(cur);
        //recursively search rooms connected
        for(var i : rooms.get(cur)){
            dfs(rooms, i);
        }
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
DFS + hash\
Time complexity: O(n + e) where n is number rooms and e is number of keys\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Very intuitive dfs done with recursion

## Key points
Corner cases:\
API: HashSet.add(), HashSet.contains()
