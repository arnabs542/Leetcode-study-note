## Keyword
Graph, DFS, BFS

## Problem description
```
Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.

Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a val (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
 

Test case format:

For simplicity sake, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val = 1, the second node with val = 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

Adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.

 

Example 1:


Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
Example 2:


Input: adjList = [[]]
Output: [[]]
Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.
Example 3:

Input: adjList = []
Output: []
Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.
Example 4:


Input: adjList = [[2],[1]]
Output: [[2],[1]]
 

Constraints:

1 <= Node.val <= 100
Node.val is unique for each node.
Number of Nodes will not exceed 100.
There is no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.

```java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;

    public Node() {}

    public Node(int _val,List<Node> _neighbors) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = _neighbors;
    }
};

class Solution {
    private HashMap <Node, Node> visited = new HashMap <> ();
    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return node;
        }

        // If the node was already visited before.
        // Return the clone from the visited dictionary.
        if (visited.containsKey(node)) {
            return visited.get(node);
        }

        // Create a clone for the given node.
        // Note that we don't have cloned neighbors as of now, hence [].
        Node cloneNode = new Node(node.val, new ArrayList<>());
        // The key is original node and value being the clone node.
        visited.put(node, cloneNode);

        // Iterate through the neighbors to generate their clones
        // and prepare a list of cloned neighbors to be added to the cloned node.
        for (Node neighbor: node.neighbors) {
            cloneNode.neighbors.add(cloneGraph(neighbor));
        }
        return cloneNode;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
DFS\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
A intuitive DFS approach done by recursion. Note we need to add the cloned node to the hash table before calling recursive calls. Otherwise the function will go into endless loop.

        // Hash map to save the visited node and it's respective clone
        // as key and value respectively. This helps to avoid cycles.

                    // Clone the neighbor and put in the visited, if not present already
                    visited.put(neighbor, new Node(neighbor.val, new ArrayList<>()));
                    // Add the newly encountered node to the queue.
                    queue.add(neighbor);
                }
                // Add the clone of the neighbor to the neighbors of the clone node "n".
                visited.get(n).neighbors.add(visited.get(neighbor));
            }
        }

        // Return the clone of the node from visited.
        return visited.get(node);
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
BFS\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
In the BFS, solution, we use a queue to keep track of nodes that haven't been linked to its neighbors. Keep in mind that we need to make a clone of the node and place the node and the clone in the hash table before pushing the node into the queue to be linked to its neighbors later.
