## Problem description
```
In a directed graph, we start at some node and every turn, walk along a directed edge of the graph.  If we reach a node that is terminal (that is, it has no outgoing directed edges), we stop.

Now, say our starting node is eventually safe if and only if we must eventually walk to a terminal node.  More specifically, there exists a natural number K so that for any choice of where to walk, we must have stopped at a terminal node in less than K steps.

Which nodes are eventually safe?  Return them as an array in sorted order.

The directed graph has N nodes with labels 0, 1, ..., N-1, where N is the length of graph.  The graph is given in the following form: graph[i] is a list of labels j such that (i, j) is a directed edge of the graph.

Example:
Input: graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]
Output: [2,4,5,6]
Here is a diagram of the above graph.

Illustration of graph

Note:

graph will have length at most 10000.
The number of edges in the graph will not exceed 32000.
Each graph[i] will be a sorted list of different integers, chosen within the range [0, graph.length - 1].

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> eventualSafeNodes(int[][] graph) {
        int n = graph.length;
        boolean[] safe = new boolean[n];
        List<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        //use hash sets to store incoming and outgoing vertices
        Set<Integer>[] incoming = new HashSet[n];
        Set<Integer>[] outgoing = new HashSet[n];
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            incoming[i] = new HashSet<>();
            outgoing[i] = new HashSet<>();
        }
        //put all vertices without outgoing edges in a queue
        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            if(graph[i].length == 0) q.add(i);
            for(var j : graph[i]){
                outgoing[i].add(j);
                incoming[j].add(i);
            }
        }
        
        //search backwards and label vertices that will lead to terminal nodes
        while(!q.isEmpty()){
            int cur = q.poll();
            //mark safe nodes
            safe[cur] = true;
            for(var i : incoming[cur]){
                outgoing[i].remove(cur);
                if(outgoing[i].size() == 0){
                    q.add(i);
                }
            }
        }
        //return safe nodes
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            if(safe[i]) ans.add(i);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

## Notes
The crux of the problem is whether you can reach a cycle from the node you start in. If you can, then there is a way to avoid stopping indefinitely; and if you can't, then after some finite number of steps you'll stop.\

Thinking about this property more, a node is eventually safe if all it's outgoing edges are to nodes that are eventually safe.\

This gives us the following idea: we start with nodes that have no outgoing edges - those are eventually safe. Now, we can update any nodes which only point to eventually safe nodes - those are also eventually safe. Then, we can update again, and so on.

## 3/9/2020 DFS

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> eventualSafeNodes(int[][] graph) {
        int n = graph.length;
        List<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        //use an array to track each node's status. 0: unvisited; 1: visiting; 2: visited(safe)
        int[] status = new int[n];
        //dfs the graph to update status for all nodes
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            if(!dfs(graph, status, i)) status[i] = 0;
        }
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            if(status[i] == 2) ans.add(i);
        }
        return ans;
    }
    //dfs method
    private boolean dfs(int[][] graph, int[] status, int cur){
        //cycle detected
        if(status[cur] == 1) return false;
        //safe path
        if(status[cur] == 2) return true;
        //mark the current node as visiting
        status[cur] = 1;
        //recursively check all child nodes
        boolean cycle = false;
        for(var i : graph[cur]){
            //when child path has cycle
            if(!dfs(graph, status, i)) return false;
        }
        //the current node is safe
        status[cur] = 2;
        return true;
    }
}
```

Space complexity: O(V)

## Notes
We can perform a easy dfs algorithm to detect cycle and mark every node's status. Then we just return nodes that are visited and safe. Note that visiting and visited(unsafe) can be the same status.
