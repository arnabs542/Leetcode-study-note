Graph, DFS, Topological sort

## Problem description
```
There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.

There may be multiple correct orders, you just need to return one of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.

Example 1:

Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished   
             course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1] .
Example 2:

Input: 4, [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,1,2,3] or [0,2,1,3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both     
             courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0. 
             So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3] .
Note:

The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.

## 3/8/2020 Postorder DFS

```java
class Solution {
    //final order
    Stack<Integer> s = new Stack<>();
    public int[] findOrder(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        //build the graph with adjacency list
        List<Integer>[] adjList = new ArrayList[numCourses];
        for(int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++){
            adjList[i]= new ArrayList<Integer>();
        }
        for(var i : prerequisites){
            adjList[i[1]].add(i[0]);
        }
        //an array to keep track of every vertice's status. 0: unvisited 1: visiting 2: visited
        int[] status = new int[numCourses];
        Arrays.fill(status, 0);
        //do dfs through all the vertices
        for(int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++){
            if(!dfs(adjList, status, i)) return new int[]{};
        }
        int[] ans = new int[numCourses];
        for(int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++){
            ans[i] = s.pop();
        }
        return ans;
    }
    private boolean dfs(List<Integer>[] adjList, int[] status, int cur){
        //cycled detected
        if(status[cur] == 1) return false;
        //the path is already visited
        if(status[cur] == 2) return true;
        //mark current node before search starts
        status[cur] = 1;
        //recursively dfs all child vertices
        for(var i : adjList[cur]){
            //cycle detected
            if(!dfs(adjList, status, i)) return false;
        }
        //add the current vertex into the array post search
        s.push(cur);
        status[cur] = 2;
        return true;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
DFS\
Time complexity: O(V)\
Space complexity: O(V)

## Notes
We can use DFS to traverse through the graph to place the answer in a stack in post order search then reverse it. Note we can create a array to record the status of any node: "unvisited", "visited", "visiting" to organize the search so we don't visit. If we encouter a visiting node during a search, it means a cycle is found so we can return the result.\

Also note that we can reverse the entire graph by adding all the edges in the reversed deriction. This way don't have to reverse the output list at the end.

## 3/8/2020 Topological sort

```java
class Solution {
  public int[] findOrder(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {

    Map<Integer, List<Integer>> adjList = new HashMap<Integer, List<Integer>>();
    int[] indegree = new int[numCourses];
    int[] topologicalOrder = new int[numCourses];

    // Create the adjacency list representation of the graph
    for (int i = 0; i < prerequisites.length; i++) {
      int dest = prerequisites[i][0];
      int src = prerequisites[i][1];
      List<Integer> lst = adjList.getOrDefault(src, new ArrayList<Integer>());
      lst.add(dest);
      adjList.put(src, lst);

      // Record in-degree of each vertex
      indegree[dest] += 1;
    }

    // Add all vertices with 0 in-degree to the queue
    Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<Integer>();
    for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
      if (indegree[i] == 0) {
        q.add(i);
      }
    }

    int i = 0;
    // Process until the Q becomes empty
    while (!q.isEmpty()) {
      int node = q.remove();
      topologicalOrder[i++] = node;

      // Reduce the in-degree of each neighbor by 1
      if (adjList.containsKey(node)) {
        for (Integer neighbor : adjList.get(node)) {
          indegree[neighbor]--;

          // If in-degree of a neighbor becomes 0, add it to the Q
          if (indegree[neighbor] == 0) {
            q.add(neighbor);
          }
        }
      }
    }

    // Check to see if topological sort is possible or not.
    if (i == numCourses) {
      return topologicalOrder;
    }

    return new int[0];
  }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Topological sort\
Time complexity: O(V)\
Space complexity: O(V)

## Notes
Use topological order to sort all the vertices in the graph and the final order will be a possible way to pass all the courses. Note that if not all vertices are added to the queue, it means the graph is not DAG.
