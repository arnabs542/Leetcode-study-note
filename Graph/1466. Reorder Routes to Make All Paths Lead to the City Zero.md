## Problem description
```
There are n cities numbered from 0 to n-1 and n-1 roads such that there is only one way to travel between two different cities (this network form a tree). Last year, The ministry of transport decided to orient the roads in one direction because they are too narrow.

Roads are represented by connections where connections[i] = [a, b] represents a road from city a to b.

This year, there will be a big event in the capital (city 0), and many people want to travel to this city.

Your task consists of reorienting some roads such that each city can visit the city 0. Return the minimum number of edges changed.

It's guaranteed that each city can reach the city 0 after reorder.

 

Example 1:



Input: n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[1,3],[2,3],[4,0],[4,5]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Change the direction of edges show in red such that each node can reach the node 0 (capital).
Example 2:



Input: n = 5, connections = [[1,0],[1,2],[3,2],[3,4]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Change the direction of edges show in red such that each node can reach the node 0 (capital).
Example 3:

Input: n = 3, connections = [[1,0],[2,0]]
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4
connections.length == n-1
connections[i].length == 2
0 <= connections[i][0], connections[i][1] <= n-1
connections[i][0] != connections[i][1]
```
## 09/25/2020 dfs
```java
class Solution {
    public int minReorder(int n, int[][] connections) {
        //build the graph, and use hashmap to store original connection direction
        Set<String> edge = new HashSet<>();
        List<Integer>[] graph = new ArrayList[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        for (int[] connection : connections) {
            int a = connection[0];
            int b = connection[1];
            graph[a].add(b);
            graph[b].add(a);
            edge.add(Integer.toString(a) + '.' + Integer.toString(b));
        }
        
        //dfs
        return dfs(graph, edge, new boolean[n], 0);
    }
    
    private int dfs(List<Integer>[] graph, Set<String> edge, boolean[] visited, int cur) {
        visited[cur] = true;
        
        int reverse = 0;
        //check neighbors
        for (int nei : graph[cur]) {
            if (!visited[nei]) {
                if (edge.contains(Integer.toString(cur) + '.' + Integer.toString(nei))) {
                    ++reverse;
                }
                reverse += dfs(graph, edge, visited, nei);
            }
        }
        return reverse;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Use dfs to traverse the tree and find all edges that need to be reversed
