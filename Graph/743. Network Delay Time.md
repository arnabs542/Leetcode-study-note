## Keyword
Graph, Union find, DFS

## Problem description
```
There are N network nodes, labelled 1 to N.

Given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (u, v, w), where u is the source node, v is the target node, and w is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

Now, we send a signal from a certain node K. How long will it take for all nodes to receive the signal? If it is impossible, return -1.

 

Example 1:



Input: times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], N = 4, K = 2
Output: 2
 

Note:

N will be in the range [1, 100].
K will be in the range [1, N].
The length of times will be in the range [1, 6000].
All edges times[i] = (u, v, w) will have 1 <= u, v <= N and 0 <= w <= 100.

## 3/15/2020 Dijkstra's Algorithm

```java
class Solution {
    
    public int networkDelayTime(int[][] times, int N, int K) {
        //build the graph
        List<int[]>[] graph = new ArrayList[N + 1];
        for(int i = 1; i <= N; i++){
            graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        for(var edges : times){
            graph[edges[0]].add(new int[]{edges[1], edges[2]});
        }
        //use priority queue to keep nodes in search
        PriorityQueue<int[]> heap = new PriorityQueue<>((x, y) -> x[1] - y[1]);
        heap.add(new int[]{K, 0});
        //use an hashmap to store time to reach each node
        Map<Integer, Integer> time = new HashMap<>();
        int ans = 0;
        //use Dijkstra's Algorithm to travel from node K to all other nodes
        while(!heap.isEmpty()){
            int[] cur = heap.poll();
            //if the node time is already in the hash table, the recorded time must be shorter than the current time
            if(time.containsKey(cur[0])) continue;
            //update time to reach all nodes
            ans = Math.max(ans, cur[1]);
            //update the reach time for the current node
            time.put(cur[0], cur[1]);
            //put new node in the queue
            for(var edge : graph[cur[0]]){
                if(!time.containsKey(edge[0]))
                    heap.add(new int[]{edge[0], edge[1] + cur[1]});
            }
        }
        //some nodes cannot be reached
        if(time.size() < N) return -1;

        return ans;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Union find\
Time complexity: O(N^2 + E)\
Space complexity: O(N + E)

## Notes
Use a union find to find out how many components are in the DSU. We need to move n - 1 edges to connect all n components.

## Key points
Corner cases: If number of edges is less than number of nodes - 1\

## 3/15/2020 DFS

```Java
class Solution {
    public int makeConnected(int n, int[][] connections) {
        //if there are equal or more than n - 1 connections, then it's always possible to form a connection grid
        if(connections.length < n - 1) return -1;
        //build the graph
        List<Integer>[] graph = new ArrayList[n];
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        for(var edge : connections){
            graph[edge[0]].add(edge[1]);
            graph[edge[1]].add(edge[0]);
        }
        //use dfs to find group number
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
        int groups = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            if(dfs(i, visited, graph)) groups++;
        }
        return groups - 1;
    }
    public boolean dfs(int cur, boolean[] visited, List<Integer>[] graph){
        if(visited[cur]) return false;
        visited[cur] = true;
        for(var nei : graph[cur]){
            dfs(nei, visited, graph);
        }
        return true;
    }
}

## Notes
We can also use DFS to find how many groups are there in the graph.
