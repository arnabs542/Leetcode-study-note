## Problem description
```
Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports [from, to], reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from JFK. Thus, the itinerary must begin with JFK.

Note:

If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string. For example, the itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a smaller lexical order than ["JFK", "LGB"].
All airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code).
You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.
Example 1:

Input: [["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"]
Example 2:

Input: [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]
Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"].
             But it is larger in lexical order.

## 3/19/2020 Post-order greedy tree traverse

```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> findItinerary(List<List<String>> tickets) {
        List<String> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        //build the graph using hashmap and priority queue
        Map<String, PriorityQueue<String>> graph = new HashMap<>();
        for(var ticket : tickets){
            String from = ticket.get(0), to = ticket.get(1);
            graph.computeIfAbsent(from, x -> new PriorityQueue<>()).add(to);
            graph.computeIfAbsent(to, x -> new PriorityQueue<>());
        }
        //use recursion to travser the graph in post order like a tree
        postOrder("JFK", ans, graph);
        //reverse the traverse result
        Collections.reverse(ans);
        return ans;
    }
    public void postOrder(String cur, List<String> ans, Map<String, PriorityQueue<String>> graph){
        PriorityQueue<String> children = graph.get(cur);
        //the priority queue helps to use greedy order to recursively visit children
        while(!children.isEmpty()){
            postOrder(children.poll(), ans, graph);
        }
        ans.add(cur);
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Greedy, post order traverse\
Time complexity: O((E/2)log(E/2)) worst case is a star shape where JFK is in the middle. The sorting of half of the edges will dominate the time complexity\
Space complexity: O(2E + V)

## Notes
This algorithm is possible because we have a fixed start node and the fact that there's always a possible Eulerian Path to traverse through the entire graph. For each node, we greedily try to traverse its children because we want the smallest child first. We can view the graph like a tree, and each node has at most two children. This is because that we might be stopped at the end node when we try one path and need to backtrack to the start and try the other path and there's only one end node. If the two path situation ever happens to a node, it means the left branch is the way to the end of the itinerary, so the traverse order will be: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 6 -> 4 -> 5. and if we use post-order traversal, we would be priting all the nodes in the reverse order of the actual itinerary path: 6 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 and we only need to reverse it after the traversal.

## Key points
Corner cases:\
API: PriorityQueue.add(), PriorityQueue.poll(), HashMap.computerIfAbsent(), HashMap.get()
