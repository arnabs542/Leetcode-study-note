## Keyword
Graph, BFS, Bit Manipulation

## Problem description
```
An undirected, connected graph of N nodes (labeled 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1) is given as graph.

graph.length = N, and j != i is in the list graph[i] exactly once, if and only if nodes i and j are connected.

Return the length of the shortest path that visits every node. You may start and stop at any node, you may revisit nodes multiple times, and you may reuse edges.

 

Example 1:

Input: [[1,2,3],[0],[0],[0]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible path is [1,0,2,0,3]
Example 2:

Input: [[1],[0,2,4],[1,3,4],[2],[1,2]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible path is [0,1,4,2,3]
 

Note:

1 <= graph.length <= 12
0 <= graph[i].length < graph.length
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int shortestPathLength(int[][] graph) {
        int n = graph.length;
        //encoded final state
        int ansState = (1 << n) - 1;
        //use array to store visited states
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[n][1 << n];
        //use bfs to traverse through the graph starting from all nodes
        Queue<int[]> q = new LinkedList<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) q.add(new int[]{i, 1 << i});
        int step = 0;
        while(!q.isEmpty()){
            int size = q.size();
            while(size-- > 0){
                int[]c = q.poll();
                int cur = c[0];
                int curState = c[1];
                //the state is already visited
                if(visited[cur][curState] == true) continue;
                //check if we have visited all nodes
                if(curState == ansState) return step;
                //mark this state as visited
                visited[cur][curState] = true;
                //expand the bfs
                for(var nei : graph[cur]){
                    q.add(new int[]{nei, curState | (1 << nei)});
                }
            }
            step++;
        }
        //if we cannot reach all the nodes
        return -1;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
BFS\
Time complexity: O(n * 2 ^ n)\
Space complexity: O(n * 2 ^ n)

## Notes
To find the shortest path to cover all nodes, we need to do BFS starting from every node to cover up the whole graph. To be efficient, we can use bit manipulation to store "state" into a single Integer.

## 3/18/2020 BFS + DP

```java
class Solution {
    public int shortestPathLength(int[][] graph) {
	int[][] dp = new int[graph.length][1<<graph.length];
        Queue<State> queue =  new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < graph.length; i++) {
            Arrays.fill(dp[i], Integer.MAX_VALUE);
            dp[i][1<<i]=0;
            queue.offer(new State(1<<i, i));
        }
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            State state = queue.poll();
            
            for (int next : graph[state.source]) {
                int nextMask = state.mask | 1 << next;
                if (dp[next][nextMask] > dp[state.source][state.mask]+1) {
                    dp[next][nextMask] = dp[state.source][state.mask]+1;
                    queue.offer(new State(nextMask, next));
                }
            }
        }
        
        int res = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < graph.length; i++) {
            res = Math.min(res, dp[i][(1<<graph.length)-1]);
        }
        return res;
	}

	class State {
		public int mask, source;
		public State(int m, int s) {
			mask=m;
			source=s;
		}
	}
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
BFS + DP\
Time complexity: O(n * 2 ^ n)\
Space complexity: O(n * 2 ^ n)

## Notes
This solution is kinda like Floyd Warshall's algorithm in the sense that it try to "relax" and update each state over and over again untill the best path is found. Time complexity is hard to calculate for this approach.
