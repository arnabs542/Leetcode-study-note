## Problem description
```
There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

Example 1:

Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
Example 2:

Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
Note:

The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.

## 3/7/2020 Postorder DFS

```java
class Solution {
  public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {

    // course -> list of next courses
    HashMap<Integer, List<Integer>> courseDict = new HashMap<>();

    // build the graph first
    for (int[] relation : prerequisites) {
      // relation[0] depends on relation[1]
      if (courseDict.containsKey(relation[1])) {
        courseDict.get(relation[1]).add(relation[0]);
      } else {
        List<Integer> nextCourses = new LinkedList<>();
        nextCourses.add(relation[0]);
        courseDict.put(relation[1], nextCourses);
      }
    }

    //unvisited: 0; visiting: 1; visited: 2;
    int[] status = new int[numCourses];

    for (int currCourse = 0; currCourse < numCourses; ++currCourse) {
      if (this.isCyclic(currCourse, courseDict, status)) {
        return false;
      }
    }

    return true;
  }


  /*
   * backtracking method to check that no cycle would be formed starting from currCourse
   */
  protected boolean isCyclic(
      Integer currCourse,
      HashMap<Integer, List<Integer>> courseDict,
      int[] status) {

    if (status[currCourse] == 1) {
      // come across a visiting node, i.e. detect the cycle
      return true;
    }
      
    if (status[currCourse] == 2) {
      // come across a previously visited node, stop
      return false;
    }

    // no following courses, no loop.
    if (!courseDict.containsKey(currCourse))
      return false;

    // before backtracking, mark the node as visiting
    status[currCourse] = 1;

    // backtracking
    for (Integer nextCourse : courseDict.get(currCourse)) {
      if(this.isCyclic(nextCourse, courseDict, status)) return true;
    }
    // after backtracking, mark as visited
    status[currCourse] = 2;
    return false;
  }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
DFS\
Time complexity: O(E + V)\
Space complexity: O(E + 3V)

## Notes
We can use DFS to traverse through the graph to find the cycle. Note we can create a array to record the status of any node: "unvisited", "visited", "visiting" to organize the search. Once we encouter a visiting node during a search, it means a cycle is found so we can return the result.

## 3/7/2020 Topology sort

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        //build adjacency list with indegrees
        Map<Integer, Node> adjList = new HashMap<>();
        for(var i : prerequisites){
          Node preCourse = adjList.putIfAbsent(i[1], new Node());
          adjList.get(i[1]).outNodes.add(i[0]);
          Node nextCourse = adjList.putIfAbsent(i[0], new Node());
          adjList.get(i[0]).inDegree++;
        }
        //prepare nodes that have 0 in degrees
        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
        for(var i : adjList.entrySet()){
            if(i.getValue().inDegree == 0) q.add(i.getKey());
        }
        //topological sort
        int removedEdges = 0;
        while(!q.isEmpty()){
            Node cur = adjList.get(q.poll());
            for(var i : cur.outNodes){
                Node outNode = adjList.get(i);
                removedEdges++;
                outNode.inDegree--;
                if(outNode.inDegree == 0){
                    q.add(i);
                }
            }
        }
        //check if all edges are removed
        return removedEdges == prerequisites.length;
    }
}
class Node{
    int inDegree;
    List<Integer> outNodes;
    public Node(){
        inDegree = 0;
        outNodes = new ArrayList<>();
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Topological sort\
Time complexity: O(2E + V)\
Space complexity: O(E + 2V) We built a graph data structure in the algorithm, which would consume E+V space. In addition, we use a container to keep track of the courses that have no prerequisite, and the size of the container would be bounded by V.

## Notes
In a directed graph, topological sort is only possible when there's no cycle in the graph. So we can try to do a topological sort and check if all edges can be processed.
