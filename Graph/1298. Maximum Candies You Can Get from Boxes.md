## Problem description
```
Given n boxes, each box is given in the format [status, candies, keys, containedBoxes] where:

status[i]: an integer which is 1 if box[i] is open and 0 if box[i] is closed.
candies[i]: an integer representing the number of candies in box[i].
keys[i]: an array contains the indices of the boxes you can open with the key in box[i].
containedBoxes[i]: an array contains the indices of the boxes found in box[i].
You will start with some boxes given in initialBoxes array. You can take all the candies in any open box and you can use the keys in it to open new boxes and you also can use the boxes you find in it.

Return the maximum number of candies you can get following the rules above.

 

Example 1:

Input: status = [1,0,1,0], candies = [7,5,4,100], keys = [[],[],[1],[]], containedBoxes = [[1,2],[3],[],[]], initialBoxes = [0]
Output: 16
Explanation: You will be initially given box 0. You will find 7 candies in it and boxes 1 and 2. Box 1 is closed and you don't have a key for it so you will open box 2. You will find 4 candies and a key to box 1 in box 2.
In box 1, you will find 5 candies and box 3 but you will not find a key to box 3 so box 3 will remain closed.
Total number of candies collected = 7 + 4 + 5 = 16 candy.
Example 2:

Input: status = [1,0,0,0,0,0], candies = [1,1,1,1,1,1], keys = [[1,2,3,4,5],[],[],[],[],[]], containedBoxes = [[1,2,3,4,5],[],[],[],[],[]], initialBoxes = [0]
Output: 6
Explanation: You have initially box 0. Opening it you can find boxes 1,2,3,4 and 5 and their keys. The total number of candies will be 6.
Example 3:

Input: status = [1,1,1], candies = [100,1,100], keys = [[],[0,2],[]], containedBoxes = [[],[],[]], initialBoxes = [1]
Output: 1
Example 4:

Input: status = [1], candies = [100], keys = [[]], containedBoxes = [[]], initialBoxes = []
Output: 0
Example 5:

Input: status = [1,1,1], candies = [2,3,2], keys = [[],[],[]], containedBoxes = [[],[],[]], initialBoxes = [2,1,0]
Output: 7
 

Constraints:

1 <= status.length <= 1000
status.length == candies.length == keys.length == containedBoxes.length == n
status[i] is 0 or 1.
1 <= candies[i] <= 1000
0 <= keys[i].length <= status.length
0 <= keys[i][j] < status.length
All values in keys[i] are unique.
0 <= containedBoxes[i].length <= status.length
0 <= containedBoxes[i][j] < status.length
All values in containedBoxes[i] are unique.
Each box is contained in one box at most.
0 <= initialBoxes.length <= status.length
0 <= initialBoxes[i] < status.lengt
```

        int ans = 0;
        //use array to record boxes found and acquired keys
        int[] found = new int[n];
        int[] ownKey = Arrays.copyOf(status, n);
        //use bfs to collect as many candies as possible
        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
        for(var i : initialBoxes){
            found[i] = 1;
            //we have 
            if(ownKey[i] == 1) q.add(i);
        }
        while(!q.isEmpty()){
            int cur = q.poll();
            //we just opened a new box
            ans += candies[cur];
            //add boxes found inside to the queue if we can unlock them
            for(var box : containedBoxes[cur]){
                found[box] = 1;
                if(ownKey[box] == 1) q.add(box);
            }
            //try using all acquired keys to open locked boxes
            for(var key : keys[cur]){
                if(ownKey[key] != 1 && found[key] == 1){
                    q.add(key);
                }
                ownKey[key] = 1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
BFS\
Time complexity: O(B + K)\
Space complexity: O(B)

## Notes
Using BFS, we only push boxes that are unlocked into the queue for further examination. Note we have to keep track of boxes that we have that are not locked, and if we can unlock old boxes with new keys in every iteration.
