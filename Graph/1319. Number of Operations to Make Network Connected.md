Graph, Union find, DFS

## Problem description
```
There are n computers numbered from 0 to n-1 connected by ethernet cables connections forming a network where connections[i] = [a, b] represents a connection between computers a and b. Any computer can reach any other computer directly or indirectly through the network.

Given an initial computer network connections. You can extract certain cables between two directly connected computers, and place them between any pair of disconnected computers to make them directly connected. Return the minimum number of times you need to do this in order to make all the computers connected. If it's not possible, return -1. 

 

Example 1:



Input: n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Remove cable between computer 1 and 2 and place between computers 1 and 3.
Example 2:



Input: n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]
Output: 2
Example 3:

Input: n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,2]]
Output: -1
Explanation: There are not enough cables.
Example 4:

Input: n = 5, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[3,4],[2,3]]
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= connections.length <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 10^5)
connections[i].length == 2
0 <= connections[i][0], connections[i][1] < n
connections[i][0] != connections[i][1]
There are no repeated connections.
No two computers are connected by more than one cable.

## 3/15/2020 Union find

```java
class Solution {
    public int makeConnected(int n, int[][] connections) {
        //if there are equal or more than n - 1 connections, then it's always possible to form a connection grid
        if(connections.length < n - 1) return -1;
        //use union find to find how many components are in the DSU
        int groups = n;
        DSU dsu = new DSU(n);
        for(var edge : connections){
            if(dsu.union(edge[0], edge[1])) groups--;
        }
        //for i groups, we need i - 1 connections to connect them together
        return groups - 1;
    }
}
class DSU{
    int[] parent;
    int[] rank;
    public DSU(int n){
        parent = new int[n];
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            parent[i] = i;
        }
        rank = new int[n];
    }
    public int find(int i){
        if(parent[i] != i) parent[i] = find(parent[i]);
        return parent[i];
    }
    public boolean union(int x, int y){
        int px = find(x);
        int py = find(y);
        if(px == py) return false;
        if(rank[px] < py) parent[px] = py;
        else if(rank[px] > py) parent[py] = px;
        else{
            parent[px] = py;
            rank[py]++;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Union find\
Time complexity: O(V + )\
Space complexity: O(V)

## Notes
Use a union find to find out how many components are in the DSU. We need to move n - 1 edges to connect all n components.

## Key points
Corner cases: If number of edges is less than number of nodes - 1\

## 3/15/2020 DFS

```Java
class Solution {
    public int makeConnected(int n, int[][] connections) {
        //if there are equal or more than n - 1 connections, then it's always possible to form a connection grid
        if(connections.length < n - 1) return -1;
        //build the graph
        List<Integer>[] graph = new ArrayList[n];
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        for(var edge : connections){
            graph[edge[0]].add(edge[1]);
            graph[edge[1]].add(edge[0]);
        }
        //use dfs to find group number
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
        int groups = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            if(dfs(i, visited, graph)) groups++;
        }
        return groups - 1;
    }
    public boolean dfs(int cur, boolean[] visited, List<Integer>[] graph){
        if(visited[cur]) return false;
        visited[cur] = true;
        for(var nei : graph[cur]){
            dfs(nei, visited, graph);
        }
        return true;
    }
}

```

Union find\
Time complexity: O(V + E)\
Space complexity: O(V)

## Notes
We can also use DFS to find how many groups are there in the graph.
