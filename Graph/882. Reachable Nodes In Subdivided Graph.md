## Keyword
Graph, Dijkstra

## Problem description
```
Starting with an undirected graph (the "original graph") with nodes from 0 to N-1, subdivisions are made to some of the edges.

The graph is given as follows: edges[k] is a list of integer pairs (i, j, n) such that (i, j) is an edge of the original graph,

and n is the total number of new nodes on that edge. 

Then, the edge (i, j) is deleted from the original graph, n new nodes (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) are added to the original graph,

and n+1 new edges (i, x_1), (x_1, x_2), (x_2, x_3), ..., (x_{n-1}, x_n), (x_n, j) are added to the original graph.

Now, you start at node 0 from the original graph, and in each move, you travel along one edge. 

Return how many nodes you can reach in at most M moves.

 

Example 1:

Input: edges = [[0,1,10],[0,2,1],[1,2,2]], M = 6, N = 3
Output: 13
Explanation: 
The nodes that are reachable in the final graph after M = 6 moves are indicated below.

Example 2:

Input: edges = [[0,1,4],[1,2,6],[0,2,8],[1,3,1]], M = 10, N = 4
Output: 23
 

Note:

0 <= edges.length <= 10000
0 <= edges[i][0] < edges[i][1] < N
There does not exist any i != j for which edges[i][0] == edges[j][0] and edges[i][1] == edges[j][1].
The original graph has no parallel edges.
0 <= edges[i][2] <= 10000
0 <= M <= 10^9
1 <= N <= 3000
A reachable node is a node that can be travelled to using at most M moves starting from node 0.

            graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        for(var edge : edges){

            }
            for(var edge : graph[cur]){
                int next = edge[0], nextStep = edge[1];
                //every x extra nodes require x + 1 steps to go through
                int stepLeft = step - nextStep - 1;
                //only add nodes when it can be reached and it hasn't been recorded yet
                if(!steps.containsKey(next) && stepLeft >= 0){
                    pq.add(new int[]{next, stepLeft});
                }
            }
        }
        //count nodes encontered
        int ans = steps.size();
        for(var edge : edges){
            int u = edge[0], v = edge[1], nodes = edge[2];
            int uStep = steps.getOrDefault(u, 0);
            int vStep = steps.getOrDefault(v, 0);
            //check if all new nodes between two nodes are covered
            ans += Math.min(nodes, uStep + vStep);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

Dijkstra\
Time complexity: O(ElogV)\
Space complexity: O(E + V)

## Notes
To find out how many nodes are covered, we can use Dijkstra to find out how many original nodes are covered along with number of steps left when these nodes are reached. Then we do another traverse through all edges and check how many new nodes are covered by evaluating steps left from each side of the edge.
