## Keyword
Graph, Shorted path in weighted graph

## Problem description
```
There are N network nodes, labelled 1 to N.

Given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (u, v, w), where u is the source node, v is the target node, and w is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

Now, we send a signal from a certain node K. How long will it take for all nodes to receive the signal? If it is impossible, return -1.

 

Example 1:



Input: times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], N = 4, K = 2
Output: 2
 

Note:

N will be in the range [1, 100].
K will be in the range [1, N].
The length of times will be in the range [1, 6000].
All edges times[i] = (u, v, w) will have 1 <= u, v <= N and 0 <= w <= 100.

            graph[edges[0]].add(new int[]{edges[1], edges[2]});
        }
        //use priority queue to keep nodes in search
        PriorityQueue<int[]> heap = new PriorityQueue<>((x, y) -> x[1] - y[1]);

        while(!heap.isEmpty()){

            //if the node time is already in the hash table, the recorded time must be shorter than the current time
            if(time.containsKey(cur[0])) continue;
            //update time to reach all nodes
            ans = Math.max(ans, cur[1]);
            //update the reach time for the current node
            time.put(cur[0], cur[1]);
            //put new node in the queue
            for(var edge : graph[cur[0]]){
                //if node has already been extract from the queue before, which means the distance to it is already the smallest, so we don't need add any other edge that leads to it
                if(!time.containsKey(edge[0]))
                    heap.add(new int[]{edge[0], edge[1] + cur[1]});
            }
        }
        //some nodes cannot be reached
        if(time.size() < N) return -1;

        return ans;
    }

## Notes
Standard Floyd Warshall Algorithm solution. This algorithm can find shortest path from every node to every other node so it's an overkill for this problem. It also works on graph with negative edges and can detect negative cycles in a graph.
