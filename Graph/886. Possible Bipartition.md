## Keyword
Graph, bipartition, DFS, BFS

## Problem description
```
Given a set of N people (numbered 1, 2, ..., N), we would like to split everyone into two groups of any size.

Each person may dislike some other people, and they should not go into the same group. 

Formally, if dislikes[i] = [a, b], it means it is not allowed to put the people numbered a and b into the same group.

Return true if and only if it is possible to split everyone into two groups in this way.

 

Example 1:

Input: N = 4, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,4]]
Output: true
Explanation: group1 [1,4], group2 [2,3]
Example 2:

Input: N = 3, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: N = 5, dislikes = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5],[1,5]]
Output: false
 

Note:

1 <= N <= 2000
0 <= dislikes.length <= 10000
1 <= dislikes[i][j] <= N
dislikes[i][0] < dislikes[i][1]
There does not exist i != j for which dislikes[i] == dislikes[j].
```


## 3/11/2020 DFS

```java
class Solution {
    List<Integer>[] graph;
    int[] color;
    public boolean possibleBipartition(int N, int[][] dislikes) {
        //build the graph
        graph = new ArrayList[N + 1];
        //0: no color; 1: red; 2: blue
        color = new int[N + 1];
        for(int i = 0; i <= N; i++){
            graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        for(var edge : dislikes){
            int n1 = edge[0], n2 = edge[1];
            graph[n1].add(n2);
            graph[n2].add(n1);
        }
        
        //perform dfs to color the graph
        for(int i = 1; i < graph.length; i++){
            //only dfs starts from nodes that are not painted
            if(color[i] == 0 && !dfs(i, 1)) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
    public boolean dfs(int cur, int c){
        //the node is already painted with a different color or same color
        if(color[cur] != 0){
            return color[cur] == c;
        } 
        //paint the node
        color[cur] = c;
        //recursively check all its neighbors' color
        for(var nei : graph[cur]){
            //try paint the neighbor with the opposite color
            if(!dfs(nei, c == 1 ? 2 : 1)) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
DFS\
Time complexity: O(E + V)\
Space complexity: O(E + V)

## Notes
Typical bipartition problem, we can use dfs to color the graph into two groups

## Notes
Not as intuitive, BFS can also do the work at about the same efficiency.
