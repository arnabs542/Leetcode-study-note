Graph, Union find, DFS

## Problem description
```
In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.

The given input is a graph that started as a tree with N nodes (with distinct values 1, 2, ..., N), with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to N, and was not an edge that already existed.

The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of edges. Each element of edges is a pair [u, v] with u < v, that represents an undirected edge connecting nodes u and v.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of N nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array. The answer edge [u, v] should be in the same format, with u < v.

Example 1:
Input: [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]
Output: [2,3]
Explanation: The given undirected graph will be like this:
  1
 / \
2 - 3
Example 2:
Input: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,4], [1,5]]
Output: [1,4]
Explanation: The given undirected graph will be like this:
5 - 1 - 2
    |   |
    4 - 3
Note:
The size of the input 2D-array will be between 3 and 1000.
Every integer represented in the 2D-array will be between 1 and N, where N is the size of the input array.

## 3/14/2020 Union find

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] findRedundantConnection(int[][] edges) {
        //build the DSU
        DSU dsu = new DSU(1001);
        //use union-find to detect the cycle
        for(var edge : edges){
            if(!dsu.union(edge[0], edge[1])) return edge;
        }
        return new int[]{};
    }
}
//DSU data structure
class DSU{
    int[] parent;
    int[] rank;
    public DSU(int n){
        parent = new int[n];
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            parent[i] = i;
        }
        rank = new int[n];
    }
    public int find(int i){
        if(parent[i] != i) parent[i] = find(parent[i]);
        return parent[i];
    }
    public boolean union(int x, int y){
        int px = find(x);
        int py = find(y);
        if(px == py) return false;
        if(rank[px] < rank[py]) parent[px] = py;
        else if(rank[px] > rank[py]) parent[py] = px;
        else {
            parent[px] = py;
            rank[py]++;
            }
        return true;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(V) because E == V in this problem\
Space complexity: O(V)

## Notes
A simple union find will detect the first edge that is forms the cycle in the graph

## 3/14/2020 DFS

```Java
class Solution {
    public int[] findRedundantConnection(int[][] edges) {
        //create a adjacency list
        List<Integer>[] graph = new ArrayList[edges.length + 1];
        for(int i = 0; i < edges.length + 1; i++){
            graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        //for each incoming edge, perform a dfs to see if the two nodes are connected
        for(var edge : edges){
            if(dfs(edge[0], edge[1], graph, new HashSet<Integer>())) return edge;
            graph[edge[0]].add(edge[1]);
            graph[edge[1]].add(edge[0]);
        }
        return new int[]{};
    }
    private boolean dfs(int u, int v, List<Integer>[] graph, Set<Integer> seen){
        //if the node is checked before, ignore
        if(seen.contains(u))return false;
        //target found
        if(u == v) return true;
        //do dfs to connected nodes
        seen.add(u);
        for(var nei : graph[u]){
            if(dfs(nei, v, graph, seen)) return true;
        }
        //search fails
        return false;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n^2)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
We use dfs to detect if the incoming edge's nodes are already connected. This is not as efficient as union find
