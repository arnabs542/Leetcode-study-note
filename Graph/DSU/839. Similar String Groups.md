## Problem description
```
Two strings X and Y are similar if we can swap two letters (in different positions) of X, so that it equals Y. Also two strings X and Y are similar if they are equal.

For example, "tars" and "rats" are similar (swapping at positions 0 and 2), and "rats" and "arts" are similar, but "star" is not similar to "tars", "rats", or "arts".

Together, these form two connected groups by similarity: {"tars", "rats", "arts"} and {"star"}.  Notice that "tars" and "arts" are in the same group even though they are not similar.  Formally, each group is such that a word is in the group if and only if it is similar to at least one other word in the group.

We are given a list A of strings.  Every string in A is an anagram of every other string in A.  How many groups are there?

 

Example 1:

Input: A = ["tars","rats","arts","star"]
Output: 2
 

Constraints:

1 <= A.length <= 2000
1 <= A[i].length <= 1000
A.length * A[i].length <= 20000
All words in A consist of lowercase letters only.
All words in A have the same length and are anagrams of each other.
The judging time limit has been increased for this question.

## 3/10/2020 Union find

```java
class Solution {
    public int numSimilarGroups(String[] A) {
        int N = A.length;
        int W = A[0].length();
        DSU dsu = new DSU(N);

        for (int i = 0; i < N - 1; ++i)
            for (int j = i+1; j < N; ++j)
                if (similar(A[i], A[j]))
                    dsu.union(i, j);

        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)
            if (dsu.parent[i] == i) ans++;

        return ans;
    }
    //check similarity
    public boolean similar(String word1, String word2) {
        int diff = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < word1.length() && diff <= 2; ++i)
            if (word1.charAt(i) != word2.charAt(i))
                diff++;
        return diff <= 2;
    }
}
//disjoint set union
class DSU {
    int[] parent;
    int[] rank;
    public DSU(int N) {
        parent = new int[N];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)
            parent[i] = i;
        rank = new int[N];
    }
    public int find(int x) {
        if (parent[x] != x) parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
        return parent[x];
    }
    public void union(int x, int y) {
        int px = find(x);
        int py = find(y);
        if(px == py) return;
        if(rank[px] < rank[py]){
            parent[px] = py;
        }
        else if(rank[px] > rank[py]){
            parent[py] = px;
        }
        else{
            parent[px] = py;
            rank[py]++;
        }
    }
}

## 3/10/2020 DFS

```java
class Solution {
    public int numSimilarGroups(String[] A) {
        int ans = 0;
        //iterate through the whole array to do dfs
        for(int i = 0; i < A.length; i++){
            if(A[i] != null){
                String s = A[i];
                A[i] = null;
                ans++;
                dfs(A, s);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
    //dfs method
    private void dfs(String[] A, String cur){
        for(int i = 0; i < A.length; i++){
            //recursively dfs similar strings of similar strings
            if(A[i] != null){
                if(similar(cur, A[i])) {
                    String s = A[i];
                    A[i] = null;
                    dfs(A, s);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    //check similarity of two groups
    private boolean similar(String s1, String s2){
        int count = 0;
        //if count > 3, we can stop the comparison right away
        for(int i = 0; i < s1.length() && count <= 2; i++){
            if(s1.charAt(i) != s2.charAt(i)) count++;
        }
        return count <= 2;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(N^2W)\
Space complexity: O(N)

## Notes
DFS can also be used in the problem. We can mark the visited string as null to avoid duplicate searches. Note we can reduce the compare time by jumping out of the loop when different character count is above 2.
