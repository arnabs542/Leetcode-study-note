## Problem description
```
There are N students in a class. Some of them are friends, while some are not. Their friendship is transitive in nature. For example, if A is a direct friend of B, and B is a direct friend of C, then A is an indirect friend of C. And we defined a friend circle is a group of students who are direct or indirect friends.

Given a N*N matrix M representing the friend relationship between students in the class. If M[i][j] = 1, then the ith and jth students are direct friends with each other, otherwise not. And you have to output the total number of friend circles among all the students.

Example 1:

Input: 
[[1,1,0],
 [1,1,0],
 [0,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation:The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, so they are in a friend circle. 
The 2nd student himself is in a friend circle. So return 2.
 

Example 2:

Input: 
[[1,1,0],
 [1,1,1],
 [0,1,1]]
Output: 1
Explanation:The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, the 1st and 2nd students are direct friends, 
so the 0th and 2nd students are indirect friends. All of them are in the same friend circle, so return 1.

 

Constraints:

1 <= N <= 200
M[i][i] == 1
M[i][j] == M[j][i]
```
## 3/4/2020 DFS with recursion

```java
class Solution {
    boolean[] visited;
    public int findCircleNum(int[][] M) {
        //create a hash table to store if the node has been visited
        visited = new boolean[M.length];
        int circle = 0;
        //iterate through all the nodes to perform dfs its connected nodes
        for(int i = 0; i < M.length; i++){
            //update visit status in each search
            if(visited[i] == false){
                dfs(M, i);
                //count each search as a circle
                circle++;
            }
        }
        return circle;
    }
    public void dfs(int[][] M, int i){
        //try dfs every connected nodes that is not visited
        for(int j = 0; j < M.length; j++){
            if(M[i][j] == 1 && visited[j] == false){
                visited[j] = true;
                dfs(M, j);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n ^ 2) the entire matrix is traversed\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
The given matrix can be viewed as the Adjacency Matrix of a graph. By viewing the matrix in such a manner, our problem reduces to the problem of finding the number of connected components in an undirected graph.

## Key points
Corner cases: empty grid or grid doesn't exist\

## 3/4/2020 BFS iteration

```java
class Solution {
    boolean[] visited;
    public int findCircleNum(int[][] M) {
        //create a hash table to store if the node has been visited
        visited = new boolean[M.length];
        //queue for breadth first search
        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
        int circle = 0;
        //iterate through all the nodes to perform dfs its connected nodes
        for(int i = 0; i < M.length; i++){
            //update visit status in each search
            if(visited[i] == false){
                //add the node to the queue
                q.add(i);
                //perform bfs of connected nodes
                while(!q.isEmpty()){
                    int n = q.poll();
                    //mark as visited
                    visited[n] = true;
                    for(int j = 0; j < M.length; j++){
                        if(M[n][j] == 1 && visited[j] == false){
                            q.add(j);
                        }
                    }
                }
                //count each search as a circle
                circle++;
            }
        }
        return circle;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n^2)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Sama idea as the last solution, we use BFS for the search method.

## Key points
Corner cases:empty grid or grid doesn't exist\
API: Queue.poll(), Queue.add(), Queue.isEmpty()

## 3/4/2020 Union Find

                   uf.union(i, j);
               } 
            }

    int[] rank;
    int circle;
    public UnionFind(int[][] M){
        int n = M.length;
        parent = new int[n];
        rank = new int[n];
        for(int i = 0; i < parent.length; i++){
            parent[i] = i;
        }
        Arrays.fill(rank, 0);
        circle = n;
    }
    public int find(int i){
        if(parent[i] != i) parent[i] = find(parent[i]);
        return parent[i];
    }
    public void union(int x, int y){
        int rootx = find(x);
        int rooty = find(y);
        if(rootx == rooty) return;
        if(rank[rootx] < rank[rooty]){
            parent[rootx] = rooty;
        }
        else if(rank[rootx] > rank[rooty]){
