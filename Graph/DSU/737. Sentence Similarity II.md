## Problem description
```
Given two sentences words1, words2 (each represented as an array of strings), and a list of similar word pairs pairs, determine if two sentences are similar.

For example, words1 = ["great", "acting", "skills"] and words2 = ["fine", "drama", "talent"] are similar, if the similar word pairs are pairs = [["great", "good"], ["fine", "good"], ["acting","drama"], ["skills","talent"]].

Note that the similarity relation is transitive. For example, if "great" and "good" are similar, and "fine" and "good" are similar, then "great" and "fine" are similar.

Similarity is also symmetric. For example, "great" and "fine" being similar is the same as "fine" and "great" being similar.

Also, a word is always similar with itself. For example, the sentences words1 = ["great"], words2 = ["great"], pairs = [] are similar, even though there are no specified similar word pairs.

Finally, sentences can only be similar if they have the same number of words. So a sentence like words1 = ["great"] can never be similar to words2 = ["doubleplus","good"].

Note:

The length of words1 and words2 will not exceed 1000.
The length of pairs will not exceed 2000.
The length of each pairs[i] will be 2.
The length of each words[i] and pairs[i][j] will be in the range [1, 20].

    //global index variable

        //different length sentences are not similar

        //use pairs to build the graph and DSU
        DSU dsu = new DSU(2 * pairs.size());

        index = 0;
        for(var pair : pairs){
            for(var word : pair){
                //map each word to an index
                if(!wordToIndex.containsKey(word)){
                    wordToIndex.put(word, index++);
                }
            }
            //union the pair in the DSU
            dsu.union(wordToIndex.get(pair.get(0)), wordToIndex.get(pair.get(1)));
        }
        //compare two sentence
        for(int i = 0; i < words1.length; i++){
            if(words1[i].equals(words2[i])) continue;
            if(!wordToIndex.containsKey(words1[i]) || !wordToIndex.containsKey(words2[i])) return false;
            if(dsu.find(wordToIndex.get(words1[i])) != dsu.find(wordToIndex.get(words2[i]))) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
class DSU{
    int[] parent;
    public DSU(int n){
        parent = new int[n];
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            parent[i] = i;
        }
    }
    public int find(int i){
        if(parent[i] != i) parent[i] = find(parent[i]);
        return parent[i];
    }
    public void union(int x, int y){
        int px = find(x), py = find(y);
        if(px == py) return;
        parent[px] = py;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(NlogP + P), where N is the maximum length of words1 and words2, and PP is the length of pairs. If we used union-by-rank, this complexity improves to O(N∗α(P)+P)≈O(N+P), where α is the Inverse-Ackermann function.\
Space complexity: O(P)

## Notes
Use DSU to process all the edges first. Then compare two sentences word by word to see if they are similar.

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(NP), where N is the maximum length of words1 and words2, and P is the length of pairs. Each of N searches could search the entire graph.\
Space complexity: O(P)

## Notes
DFS is not as intuitive nor efficient in this problem. Use union find instead.
