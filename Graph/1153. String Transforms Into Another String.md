## Problem description
```
Given two strings str1 and str2 of the same length, determine whether you can transform str1 into str2 by doing zero or more conversions.

In one conversion you can convert all occurrences of one character in str1 to any other lowercase English character.

Return true if and only if you can transform str1 into str2.

 

Example 1:

Input: str1 = "aabcc", str2 = "ccdee"
Output: true
Explanation: Convert 'c' to 'e' then 'b' to 'd' then 'a' to 'c'. Note that the order of conversions matter.
Example 2:

Input: str1 = "leetcode", str2 = "codeleet"
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to transform str1 to str2.
 

Note:

1 <= str1.length == str2.length <= 10^4
Both str1 and str2 contain only lowercase English letters.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canConvert(String s1, String s2) {
        //special case, when two strings are equal
        if (s1.equals(s2)) return true;
        //use hashmap to store character to character relationship
        Map<Character, Character> dp = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < s1.length(); ++i) {
            //1 character cannot be mapped to multiple characters
            if (dp.containsKey(s1.charAt(i)) && dp.get(s1.charAt(i)) != s2.charAt(i)) {
                return false;
            }
            dp.put(s1.charAt(i), s2.charAt(i));
        }
        //to have a valid way to transform the input string, the mapped to character needs to be less than 26
        return new HashSet<Character>(dp.values()).size() < 26;
    }
}
```

## Notes
First, we create a mapping relationship of characters from str1 and str2. Note one character cannot be mapped to multiple characters. There are few cases: when the mapping form a link: a -> b -> c, we can juse transform backwards like b -> c then a -> b; when multiple characters map to the same characters: a ->b , c -> b, we can transform a -> c, then c -> b; when there's a cycle: a -> b -> c -> a, we need an unused character to break the link like c -> tmp, b -> c, a -> b, tmp -> a.\
In conclusion, if there's no cases when one character is mapped to multiple characters, we almost always have a way to transform str1 to str2 except when all 26 characters are mapped to 26 different characters. In this case, there must be a cycle and there's no extra unused character that can be "created" because no two characters are mapped to the same character. So we just need to check if there are 26 different values in the hashmap.
