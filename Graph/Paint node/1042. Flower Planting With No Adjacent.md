## Keyword
Graph, Greedy, DFS

## Problem description
```
You have N gardens, labelled 1 to N.  In each garden, you want to plant one of 4 types of flowers.

paths[i] = [x, y] describes the existence of a bidirectional path from garden x to garden y.

Also, there is no garden that has more than 3 paths coming into or leaving it.

Your task is to choose a flower type for each garden such that, for any two gardens connected by a path, they have different types of flowers.

Return any such a choice as an array answer, where answer[i] is the type of flower planted in the (i+1)-th garden.  The flower types are denoted 1, 2, 3, or 4.  It is guaranteed an answer exists.

 

Example 1:

Input: N = 3, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: [1,2,3]
Example 2:

Input: N = 4, paths = [[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: [1,2,1,2]
Example 3:

Input: N = 4, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,1],[1,3],[2,4]]
Output: [1,2,3,4]
 

Note:

1 <= N <= 10000
0 <= paths.size <= 20000
No garden has 4 or more paths coming into or leaving it.
It is guaranteed an answer exists.

## 3/12/2020 Greedy

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] gardenNoAdj(int N, int[][] paths) {
        //build the graph
        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph = new HashMap<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < N; i++) graph.put(i, new ArrayList<>());
        for(var edge : paths){
            graph.get(edge[0] - 1).add(edge[1] - 1);
            graph.get(edge[1] - 1).add(edge[0] - 1);
        }
        //plant flowers in greedy algorithm
        int[] res = new int[N];
        for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){
            //4 different flowers plus no flower
            boolean[] flower = new boolean[5];
            //iterate through neighbor gradens to see which flowers are planted already
            for(var nei : graph.get(i)){
                flower[res[nei]] = true;
            }
            //plant the first flower available
            for(int f = 1; f < 5; f++){
                if(flower[f] == false){
                    res[i] = f;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(E + V)\
Space complexity: O(E + V)

## Notes
Simple greedy algorithm is possible because we know there's an answer and each garden has less neighbors than possible flowers.

## 7/8/2020 DFS

```java
class Solution {
    List<Integer>[] graph;
    public int[] gardenNoAdj(int N, int[][] paths) {
        //build the graph
        graph = new ArrayList[N + 1];
        for(int i = 1; i < N + 1; i++){
            graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        for(var edge : paths){
            graph[edge[0]].add(edge[1]);
            graph[edge[1]].add(edge[0]);
        }
        //use dfs to color gradens
        int[] ans = new int[N];
        for(int i = 1; i < N + 1; i++){
            if(ans[i - 1] == 0) DFS(ans, i);
        }
        return ans;
    }
    private void DFS(int[] ans, int cur){
        boolean[] colored = new boolean[5];
        //check color of adjacent gardens
        for(var nei : graph[cur]){
            if(ans[nei - 1] != 0) colored[ans[nei - 1]] = true;
        }
        for(int i = 1; i < 5; i++){
            if(colored[i] == false){
                ans[cur - 1] = i;
                break;
            }
        }
        //recursively color uncolored gardens
        for(var nei : graph[cur]){
            if(ans[nei - 1] == 0) DFS(ans, nei);
        }
    }
}
