## Problem description
```
Given a list accounts, each element accounts[i] is a list of strings, where the first element accounts[i][0] is a name, and the rest of the elements are emails representing emails of the account.

Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely belong to the same person if there is some email that is common to both accounts. Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to different people as people could have the same name. A person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts definitely have the same name.

After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are emails in sorted order. The accounts themselves can be returned in any order.

Example 1:
Input: 
accounts = [["John", "johnsmith@mail.com", "john00@mail.com"], ["John", "johnnybravo@mail.com"], ["John", "johnsmith@mail.com", "john_newyork@mail.com"], ["Mary", "mary@mail.com"]]
Output: [["John", 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.com'],  ["John", "johnnybravo@mail.com"], ["Mary", "mary@mail.com"]]
Explanation: 
The first and third John's are the same person as they have the common email "johnsmith@mail.com".
The second John and Mary are different people as none of their email addresses are used by other accounts.
We could return these lists in any order, for example the answer [['Mary', 'mary@mail.com'], ['John', 'johnnybravo@mail.com'], 
['John', 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.com']] would still be accepted.
Note:

The length of accounts will be in the range [1, 1000].
The length of accounts[i] will be in the range [1, 10].
The length of accounts[i][j] will be in the range [1, 30].

## 3/11/2020 DFS

```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<String>> accountsMerge(List<List<String>> accounts) {
        //use hashmap to map emails to names and to build the adjacency list
        Map<String, String> emailToName = new HashMap<>();
        Map<String, List<String>> graph = new HashMap<>();
        for(var i : accounts){
            //if an account has no emails
            if(i.size() == 1) continue;
            for(int j = 1; j < i.size(); j++){
                String email = i.get(j);
                //map emails to names
                emailToName.putIfAbsent(email, i.get(0));
                //for the first email, only create the list
                if(j == 1){
                    graph.computeIfAbsent(email, x -> new ArrayList<>());
                    continue;
                }
                //create edges from the first email to the rest of the list
                graph.computeIfAbsent(email, x -> new ArrayList<>()).add(i.get(1));
                graph.computeIfAbsent(i.get(1), x -> new ArrayList<>()).add(email);
            }
        }
        //list store merged accounts
        List<List<String>> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        //hash set to store visited status
        Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
        //add emails
        for(var email : emailToName.keySet()){
            //create a new list
            List<String> acc = new ArrayList<>();
            //perform dfs to find all connected emails
            dfs(graph, acc, email, visited);
            //add the list to the collection
            if(!acc.isEmpty()) ans.add(acc);
        }
        //add names
        for(var account : ans){
            //sort emails
            Collections.sort(account);
            //add names
            account.add(0, emailToName.get(account.get(0)));
        }
        //convert the hashmap to a list
        return ans;
    }
    //dfs method
    public void dfs(Map<String, List<String>> graph, List<String> acc, String cur, Set<String> visited){
        //if the email is visited
        if(visited.contains(cur)) return;
        //mark current node
        visited.add(cur);
        acc.add(cur);
        //recursively visit every email connected to the current
        for(var i : graph.get(cur)){
            dfs(graph, acc, i, visited);
        }
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(∑(ai)log(ai)), where ai is the length of accounts[i]. Without the log factor, this is the complexity to build the graph and search for each component. The log factor is for sorting each component at the end.\
Space complexity: O(∑ai)

## Notes
Since A/C = A/B * B/C, the problem comes down to finding a path in the graph from A to C. Thus we can use DFS to search the graph for each query.

## Key points
Corner cases: \
API: HashSet.add(), HashSet.contains(), HashMap.putIfAbsent(), HashMap.containsKey(), HashMap.get(), HashMap.keySet(), HashMap.values(), HashMap.computeIfAbsent()

## 3/11/2020 Union Find

```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<String>> accountsMerge(List<List<String>> accounts) {
        //maximum number of email and names are 10000
        DSU dsu = new DSU(10000);
        //use hashmap to map emails to names and emails to index
        Map<String, String> emailToName = new HashMap<>();
        Map<String, Integer> emailToIndex = new HashMap<>();
        int index = 0;
        for(var i : accounts){
            //if an account has no emails
            if(i.size() == 1) continue;
            for(int j = 1; j < i.size(); j++){
                String email = i.get(j);
                //map emails to names
                emailToName.putIfAbsent(email, i.get(0));
                //union new emails to the first email of the account
                if(!emailToIndex.containsKey(email)){
                    emailToIndex.put(email, index);
                    dsu.union(index, emailToIndex.get(i.get(1)));
                    index++;
                }
                //if an existing email appears, union the first email of the account to the existing email
                else{
                    dsu.union(emailToIndex.get(email), emailToIndex.get(i.get(1)));
                }
            }
        }
        //use hashmap to store accounts
        Map<Integer, List<String>> ans = new HashMap<>();
        //add emails
        for(var email : emailToName.keySet()){
            //find the component
            int in = dsu.find(emailToIndex.get(email));
            //attach emails to the list it belongs
            ans.computeIfAbsent(in, dummy -> new ArrayList()).add(email);
        }
        //add names
        for(var account : ans.values()){
            //sort emails
            Collections.sort(account);
            //add names
            account.add(0, emailToName.get(account.get(0)));
        }
        //convert the hashmap to a list
        return new ArrayList(ans.values());
    }
}
class DSU{
    int[] parent;
    public DSU(int n){
        parent = new int[n];
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            parent[i] = i;
        }
    }
    public int find(int i){
        if(parent[i] != i) parent[i] = find(parent[i]);
        return parent[i];
    }
    public void union(int x, int y){
        int px = find(x), py = find(y);
        if(px == py) return;
        parent[px] = py;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity:  O(AlogA), where A = ∑ ai, and ai is the length of accounts[i]. If we used union-by-rank, this complexity improves to O(Aα(A))≈O(A), where α is the Inverse-Ackermann function.\
Space complexity: O(A), the space used by our DSU structure.

## Notes
We can use union find to group emails together while using hashmap to map every email to a name and an index. Note that it's possible to also give emails in the same account only 1 index since they are naturally unioned together.
