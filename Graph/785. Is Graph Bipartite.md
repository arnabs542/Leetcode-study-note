Graph, bipartition, DFS, BFS

## Problem description
```
Given an undirected graph, return true if and only if it is bipartite.

Recall that a graph is bipartite if we can split it's set of nodes into two independent subsets A and B such that every edge in the graph has one node in A and another node in B.

The graph is given in the following form: graph[i] is a list of indexes j for which the edge between nodes i and j exists.  Each node is an integer between 0 and graph.length - 1.  There are no self edges or parallel edges: graph[i] does not contain i, and it doesn't contain any element twice.

Example 1:
Input: [[1,3], [0,2], [1,3], [0,2]]
Output: true
Explanation: 
The graph looks like this:
0----1
|    |
|    |
3----2
We can divide the vertices into two groups: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.
Example 2:
Input: [[1,2,3], [0,2], [0,1,3], [0,2]]
Output: false
Explanation: 
The graph looks like this:
0----1
| \  |
|  \ |
3----2
We cannot find a way to divide the set of nodes into two independent subsets.
 

Note:

graph will have length in range [1, 100].
graph[i] will contain integers in range [0, graph.length - 1].
graph[i] will not contain i or duplicate values.
The graph is undirected: if any element j is in graph[i], then i will be in graph[j].

## 3/11/2020 DFS

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isBipartite(int[][] graph) {
        //use hashmap to recor painted color of each node. false: blue, true: red
        Map<Integer, Boolean> color = new HashMap<>();
        //use dfs to check if we can bipartition the graph
        for(int i = 0; i < graph.length; i++){
            //only perform dfs starting from nodes that are not painted
            if(!color.containsKey(i) && !dfs(i, graph, color, true)) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
    private boolean dfs(int i, int[][] graph, Map<Integer, Boolean> color, boolean c){
        //if the node already has a color, check if it's the color that we want to paint it
        if(color.containsKey(i)) return color.get(i) == c;
        //paint the node
        color.put(i, c);
        //recursively check all the nodes with the opposite color
        for(var nei : graph[i]){
            if(!dfs(nei, graph, color, !c)) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

DFS\
Time complexity: O(E + V)\
Space complexity: O(V)

## Notes
Typical bipartition problem, we can use dfs to color the graph into two groups

```java
class Solution {

        int[] color = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(color, -1);

        for (int start = 0; start < n; ++start) {
            if (color[start] == -1) {
                Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack();
                stack.push(start);
                color[start] = 0;
