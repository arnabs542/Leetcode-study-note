## Keyword
Graph, in and out degree

## Problem description
```
In a town, there are N people labelled from 1 to N.  There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:

The town judge trusts nobody.
Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.
You are given trust, an array of pairs trust[i] = [a, b] representing that the person labelled a trusts the person labelled b.

If the town judge exists and can be identified, return the label of the town judge.  Otherwise, return -1.

 

Example 1:

Input: N = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 3
Example 3:

Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1
Example 4:

Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: -1
Example 5:

Input: N = 4, trust = [[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[4,3]]
Output: 3
 

Note:

1 <= N <= 1000
trust.length <= 10000
trust[i] are all different
trust[i][0] != trust[i][1]
1 <= trust[i][0], trust[i][1] <= N
```


## 3/12/2020 Greedy

```java
class Solution {
    public int findJudge(int N, int[][] trust) {
        //calculate total degrees for each node
        int[] degree = new int[N + 1];
        for(var edge : trust){
            degree[edge[1]]++;
            degree[edge[0]]--;
        }
        //check if the judge exist
        for(int i = 1; i < N + 1; i++){
            if(degree[i] == N - 1) return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}

```

## Complexity Analyze
in & out degree\
Time complexity: O(N + T)\
Space complexity: O(N)

## Notes
We only need to calculate in and out degrees for each node. The judge is the only node that has N-1 total degress
