## Keyword
DFS BFS

## Problem description
```
In a given 2D binary array A, there are two islands.  (An island is a 4-directionally connected group of 1s not connected to any other 1s.)

Now, we may change 0s to 1s so as to connect the two islands together to form 1 island.

Return the smallest number of 0s that must be flipped.  (It is guaranteed that the answer is at least 1.)

 

Example 1:

Input: [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: [[0,1,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 2
Example 3:

Input: [[1,1,1,1,1],[1,0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0,1],[1,0,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1]]
Output: 1
 

Note:

1 <= A.length = A[0].length <= 100
A[i][j] == 0 or A[i][j] == 1

## Complexity Analyze
BFS + DFS\
Time complexity: O(m * n)\
Space complexity: O(m * n)

## Notes
Since there are two islands, we can use DFS to mark the 1st island differently, then use BFS to starting from this island to find the shortest path to the next island.
