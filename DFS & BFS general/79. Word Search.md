## Keyword
DFS, Backtracking

## Problem description
```
Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

Example:

board =
[
  ['A','B','C','E'],
  ['S','F','C','S'],
  ['A','D','E','E']
]

Given word = "ABCCED", return true.
Given word = "SEE", return true.
Given word = "ABCB", return false.
 

Constraints:

board and word consists only of lowercase and uppercase English letters.
1 <= board.length <= 200
1 <= board[i].length <= 200
1 <= word.length <= 10^3
```

        }
        
        //if the current position is invalid or the current position is visited or the character mismatch, current search fails

        }
        
        //mark the current node as visited

            if(DFS(board, word, r + dir[i], c + dir[i + 1], index + 1)) return true;
        }
        
        //unmark the current node as visited for other searches
        visited[r][c] = false;

## Complexity Analyze
DFS backtracking\
Time complexity: O(m * n * 4^l) we have to do m * n searches, each search takes 4^l because we to do l searches to match the word and each time we have 4 directions to go\
Space complexity: O(m * n + l) m * n to keep visited status and l for DFS depth(stack space).

## Notes
Starting for every point in the matrix, we use DFS trying to find a match. Note we have to mark visited nodes during the search and release it when we backtrack. Note that instead of using a visited matrix, we can also temporarily mark the node as a non-letter, then mark it back after the backtrack.
