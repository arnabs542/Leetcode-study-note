## Keyword
DFS, Backtracking

## Problem description
```
Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

Example:

board =
[
  ['A','B','C','E'],
  ['S','F','C','S'],
  ['A','D','E','E']
]

Given word = "ABCCED", return true.
Given word = "SEE", return true.
Given word = "ABCB", return false.
 

Constraints:

board and word consists only of lowercase and uppercase English letters.
1 <= board.length <= 200
1 <= board[i].length <= 200
1 <= word.length <= 10^3
```

## 4/17/2020 DFS backtracking

```java
class Solution {
    boolean[] colStatus;
    // \\\direction
    boolean[] diaStatus1;
    // ///direction
    boolean[] diaStatus2;
    
    int ans = 0;
    public int totalNQueens(int n) {
        //initialize status storages
        colStatus = new boolean[n];
        diaStatus1 = new boolean[2 * n - 1];
        diaStatus2 = new boolean[2 * n - 1];
        
        //dfs for all answers
        DFS(n, 0);
        
        return ans;
    }
    //do DFS row by row
    private void DFS(int n, int r){
        //we have a possible answer
        if(r == n){
            ans++;
        }
        
        //backtracking
        //try placing the queen on each position of the row
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            //compute dia index
            int dia1 = n - 1 + i - r;
            int dia2 = i + r;
            //only place it if colon, dia1 and dia2 are clear
            if(!colStatus[i] && !diaStatus1[dia1] && !diaStatus2[dia2]){
                colStatus[i] = true;
                diaStatus1[dia1] = true;
                diaStatus2[dia2] = true;
                DFS(n, r + 1);
                colStatus[i] = false;
                diaStatus1[dia1] = false;
                diaStatus2[dia2] = false;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
DFS backtracking\
Time complexity: O(m * n * 4^l) we have to do m * n searches, each search takes 4^l because we to do l searches to match the word and each time we have 4 directions to go\
Space complexity: O(m * n + l) m * n to keep visited status and l for DFS depth(stack space).

## Notes
Starting for every point in the matrix, we use DFS trying to find a match. Note we have to mark visited nodes during the search and release it when we backtrack. Note that instead of using a visited matrix, we can also temporarily mark the node as a non-letter, then mark it back after the backtrack.
