## Keyword
String Backtracking

## Problem description
```
Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.

For example, given n = 3, a solution set is:

[
  "((()))",
  "(()())",
  "(())()",
  "()(())",
  "()()()"
]
```

## 4/15/2020 Backtracking

```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> generateParenthesis(int n) {
        List<String> ans = new ArrayList();
        backtrack(ans, "", 0, 0, n);
        return ans;
    }

    public void backtrack(List<String> ans, String cur, int open, int close, int max){
        if (cur.length() == max * 2) {
            ans.add(cur);
            return;
        }

        if (open < max)
            backtrack(ans, cur+"(", open+1, close, max);
        if (close < open)
            backtrack(ans, cur+")", open, close+1, max);
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Same as above\
Time complexity: O(4^n / n^(1/2))\
Space complexity: O(4^n / n^(1/2))

## Notes
Instead of adding '(' or ')' every time as in Approach 1, let's only add them when we know it will remain a valid sequence. We can do this by keeping track of the number of opening and closing brackets we have placed so far.\
We can start an opening bracket if we still have one (of n) left to place. And we can start a closing bracket if it would not exceed the number of opening brackets.

## 1/29/2020 Solution breaking the problem down

```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> generateParenthesis(int n) {
        List<String> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        //base case
        if(n == 0){
            ans.add("");
        }
        //recursion case
        else {
            for(int c = 0; c < n; c++) //c is the position of the closing bracket of the first bracket
                for(String left: generateParenthesis(c))
                    for(String right: generateParenthesis(n - c - 1)){
                        ans.add("(" + left + ")" + right);
                    }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Our complexity analysis rests on understanding how many elements there are in generateParenthesis(n). This analysis is outside the scope of this article, but it turns out this is the n-th Catalan number\
Time complexity: O(4^n / n^(1/2))\
Space complexity: O(4^n / n^(1/2))

## Notes
To enumerate something, generally we would like to express it as a sum of disjoint subsets that are easier to count.\
Consider the closure number of a valid parentheses sequence S: the least index >= 0 so that S[0], S[1], ..., S[2*index+1] is valid. Clearly, every parentheses sequence has a unique closure number. We can try to enumerate them individually.
