## Problem description
```
On an N x N board, the numbers from 1 to N*N are written boustrophedonically starting from the bottom left of the board, and alternating direction each row.  For example, for a 6 x 6 board, the numbers are written as follows:


You start on square 1 of the board (which is always in the last row and first column).  Each move, starting from square x, consists of the following:

You choose a destination square S with number x+1, x+2, x+3, x+4, x+5, or x+6, provided this number is <= N*N.
(This choice simulates the result of a standard 6-sided die roll: ie., there are always at most 6 destinations, regardless of the size of the board.)
If S has a snake or ladder, you move to the destination of that snake or ladder.  Otherwise, you move to S.
A board square on row r and column c has a "snake or ladder" if board[r][c] != -1.  The destination of that snake or ladder is board[r][c].

Note that you only take a snake or ladder at most once per move: if the destination to a snake or ladder is the start of another snake or ladder, you do not continue moving.  (For example, if the board is `[[4,-1],[-1,3]]`, and on the first move your destination square is `2`, then you finish your first move at `3`, because you do not continue moving to `4`.)

Return the least number of moves required to reach square N*N.  If it is not possible, return -1.

Example 1:

Input: [
[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
[-1,35,-1,-1,13,-1],
[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
[-1,15,-1,-1,-1,-1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
At the beginning, you start at square 1 [at row 5, column 0].
You decide to move to square 2, and must take the ladder to square 15.
You then decide to move to square 17 (row 3, column 5), and must take the snake to square 13.
You then decide to move to square 14, and must take the ladder to square 35.
You then decide to move to square 36, ending the game.
It can be shown that you need at least 4 moves to reach the N*N-th square, so the answer is 4.
Note:

2 <= board.length = board[0].length <= 20
board[i][j] is between 1 and N*N or is equal to -1.
The board square with number 1 has no snake or ladder.
The board square with number N*N has no snake or ladder.

```java

    public int snakesAndLadders(int[][] board) {
        int n = board.length;
        //use array to store visited status
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n * n];
        //use queue to help implement bfs
        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();

        visited[0] = true;
        int step = 0;
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            for (int size = q.size(); size > 0; --size) {
                int curr = q.poll();
                //reach destination
                if (curr == n * n - 1) {
                    return step;
                }
                //6 possible moves

                    if (board[nextRC[0]][nextRC[1]] != -1) {
                        next = board[nextRC[0]][nextRC[1]] - 1;
                    }

        return -1;
    }
    private int[] transform(int dis, int n) {
        int r = dis / n;
        int c = dis % n;
        c = (r % 2 == 0) ? c : n - c - 1;
        r = n - r - 1;
        return new int[] {r, c};
    }
}

## Complexity Analyze
BFS\
Time complexity: O(n ^ 2))\
Space complexity: O(n ^ 2)

## Notes
Simple BFS. Note we need to transform the cell number to actual board location to check for ladderr and nake. Also note that we can move the according to ladder and snake first, then check for visited status.
