## Problem description
```
In a 2D grid of 0s and 1s, we change at most one 0 to a 1.

After, what is the size of the largest island? (An island is a 4-directionally connected group of 1s).

Example 1:

Input: [[1, 0], [0, 1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Change one 0 to 1 and connect two 1s, then we get an island with area = 3.
Example 2:

Input: [[1, 1], [1, 0]]
Output: 4
Explanation: Change the 0 to 1 and make the island bigger, only one island with area = 4.
Example 3:

Input: [[1, 1], [1, 1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: Can't change any 0 to 1, only one island with area = 4.
 

Notes:

1 <= grid.length = grid[0].length <= 50.
0 <= grid[i][j] <= 1.

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n ^ 2)\
Space complexity: O(n ^ 2))

## Notes
The obvious solution for this problem is to perform dfs to find land area for every water node. But we can use DP to store each island's area then do the same search for each water node. And even better, we can combine the two into 1 pass. Note we can use another function to check through all the neighboring nodes to make the code more concise.
