## Problem description
```
The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n√ón chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.



Given an integer n, return the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Example:

Input: 4
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown below.
[
 [".Q..",  // Solution 1
  "...Q",
  "Q...",
  "..Q."],

 ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
  "Q...",
  "...Q",
  ".Q.."]
]
```

        //backtracking
        //try placing the queen on each position of the row
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            //compute dia index
            int dia1 = n - 1 + i - r;
            int dia2 = i + r;
            //only place it if colon, dia1 and dia2 are clear
            if(!colStatus[i] && !diaStatus1[dia1] && !diaStatus2[dia2]){
                colStatus[i] = true;
                diaStatus1[dia1] = true;
                diaStatus2[dia2] = true;
                DFS(n, r + 1);
                colStatus[i] = false;
                diaStatus1[dia1] = false;
                diaStatus2[dia2] = false;
            }
        }
    }
}

## Complexity Analyze
DFS backtracking\
Time complexity: O(n!) There is N possibilities to put the first queen, not more than N (N - 2) to put the second one, not more than N(N - 2)(N - 4) for the third one etc. In total that results in O(N!) time complexity.\
Space complexity: O(n) to keep an information about diagonals and rows.

## Notes
We use 3 arrays to store the number status of if each row, diagonal1 and diagonal2 is occupied. Then we do a regular DFS backtracking search row by row trying to permulate all possible answers of the N queen problem.
