## Problem description
```
A gene string can be represented by an 8-character long string, with choices from "A", "C", "G", "T".

Suppose we need to investigate about a mutation (mutation from "start" to "end"), where ONE mutation is defined as ONE single character changed in the gene string.

For example, "AACCGGTT" -> "AACCGGTA" is 1 mutation.

Also, there is a given gene "bank", which records all the valid gene mutations. A gene must be in the bank to make it a valid gene string.

Now, given 3 things - start, end, bank, your task is to determine what is the minimum number of mutations needed to mutate from "start" to "end". If there is no such a mutation, return -1.

Note:

Starting point is assumed to be valid, so it might not be included in the bank.
If multiple mutations are needed, all mutations during in the sequence must be valid.
You may assume start and end string is not the same.
 

Example 1:

start: "AACCGGTT"
end:   "AACCGGTA"
bank: ["AACCGGTA"]

return: 1
 

Example 2:

start: "AACCGGTT"
end:   "AAACGGTA"
bank: ["AACCGGTA", "AACCGCTA", "AAACGGTA"]

return: 2
 

Example 3:

start: "AAAAACCC"
end:   "AACCCCCC"
bank: ["AAAACCCC", "AAACCCCC", "AACCCCCC"]

return: 3
```


## 3/12/2020 BFS

```java
class Solution {
    public int minMutation(String start, String end, String[] bank) {
        //use hashset to store elements visited
        Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
        //use queue to do bfs
        Queue<String> q = new LinkedList<>();
        q.add(start);
        visited.add(start);
        //number of mutations
        int mutation = 0;
        //bfs
        while(!q.isEmpty()){
            int size = q.size();
            for(int i = 0; i < size; i++){
                String cur = q.poll();
                //the end mutation found
                if(cur.equals(end)) return mutation;
                //find all next valid mutation
                for(var mut : bank){
                    if(!visited.contains(mut) && valid(cur, mut)){
                        visited.add(mut);
                        q.add(mut);
                    }
                }
            }
            mutation++;
        }
        //mutation path was not found
        return -1;
    }
    //check if it's a valid mutation
    private boolean valid(String g1, String g2){
        int diff = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < 8 && diff < 2; i++){
            if(g1.charAt(i) != g2.charAt(i)) diff++;
        }
        return diff == 1;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n ^ 2) in the worst case, when the graph is skewered in a line, every node needs to be compared with all that's left and the time complexity will be n ^ 2\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
For every node in the queue, we do a search of all it's connected mutation and put these checkd nodes into the queue. The cycle ends when we find the target or run out of nodes to search. Note it is possible to use DFS to solve this problem, but it's very counter-intuitive.
