https://leetcode.com/problems/bus-routes/

## Keyword
Graph, unweighted shortest path, BFS

## Problem description
```
We have a list of bus routes. Each routes[i] is a bus route that the i-th bus repeats forever. For example if routes[0] = [1, 5, 7], this means that the first bus (0-th indexed) travels in the sequence 1->5->7->1->5->7->1->... forever.

We start at bus stop S (initially not on a bus), and we want to go to bus stop T. Travelling by buses only, what is the least number of buses we must take to reach our destination? Return -1 if it is not possible.

Example:
Input: 
routes = [[1, 2, 7], [3, 6, 7]]
S = 1
T = 6
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The best strategy is take the first bus to the bus stop 7, then take the second bus to the bus stop 6.
Note:

1 <= routes.length <= 500.
1 <= routes[i].length <= 500.
0 <= routes[i][j] < 10 ^ 6.
```

    public int numBusesToDestination(int[][] routes, int S, int T) {
        //corner case
        if(S == T) return 0;
        
        int N = routes.length;
        
        //use hash map to map every stop to all buses that pass it

        Set<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>();
        
        //put all buses that contains stop S in the queue to start with
        for(var bus : stops.get(S)){
            q.add(bus);

                int cur = q.poll();
                //if the current bus can reach the final stop, end the search
                if(stops.get(T).contains(cur)) return number;
                //expand the next round of searches
                for(int bus = 0; bus < routes.length; bus++){
                    if(!seen.contains(bus) && overlap(routes[bus], routes[cur])){
                        q.add(bus);
                        seen.add(bus);
                    }

            number++;
        }
        return -1;
    }
    //determine if two buses have overlapping stops
    private boolean overlap(int[] r1, int[] r2){
        //use two pointers since the arrays are sorted
        for(int i = 0, j = 0; i < r1.length && j < r2.length;){
            if(r1[i] == r2[j]) return true;
            if(r1[i] < r2[j]) i++;
            else j++;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n ^ 2 + Σbi) In the worst case, when the graph is skewered in a line, every node needs to be compared with all that's left and the time complexity will be n ^ 2. We also need iterate through every single stop\
Space complexity: O(Σbi + n)  we need Σbi space to store the mapping relations of buses and stops and n for the bfs

## Notes
We treat bus as node in a graph in this solution. The routes help us determine which bus nodes are connected to each other. Now the problem becomes how to travel from one bus to another. Note we can also use hashset to compare two bus routes to see if they overlap.

        }

    }
    return -1;
  }
};
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(m * n)\
Space complexity: O(m * n + m) 

## Notes
We can also use each stop as a node.
