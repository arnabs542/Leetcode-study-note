## Keyword
DFS

## Problem description
```
You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.

Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).

The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the water around the island). One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.

 

Example:

Input:
[[0,1,0,0],
 [1,1,1,0],
 [0,1,0,0],
 [1,1,0,0]]

Output: 16

Explanation: The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image below:

      int nr = row + dir[i];
      int nc = col + dir[i + 1];
      if (nr < 0 || nr >= m || nc < 0 || nc >= n || grid[nr][nc] == 0) {
          //only increment the perimeter when we reach water or out of bond
       ++perimeter;
       continue;
      }
      if (grid[nr][nc] == 2) {
       continue;

## Complexity Analyze
DFS\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(1) overall, O(n) stack call

## Notes
Find the first cell of the land and do dfs, only increment the perimeter when we reach water or out of bond.
