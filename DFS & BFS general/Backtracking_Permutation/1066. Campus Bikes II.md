## Problem description
```
On a campus represented as a 2D grid, there are N workers and M bikes, with N <= M. Each worker and bike is a 2D coordinate on this grid.

We assign one unique bike to each worker so that the sum of the Manhattan distances between each worker and their assigned bike is minimized.

The Manhattan distance between two points p1 and p2 is Manhattan(p1, p2) = |p1.x - p2.x| + |p1.y - p2.y|.

Return the minimum possible sum of Manhattan distances between each worker and their assigned bike.

 

Example 1:


Input: workers = [[0,0],[2,1]], bikes = [[1,2],[3,3]]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
We assign bike 0 to worker 0, bike 1 to worker 1. The Manhattan distance of both assignments is 3, so the output is 6.
Example 2:


Input: workers = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,0]], bikes = [[1,0],[2,2],[2,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
We first assign bike 0 to worker 0, then assign bike 1 to worker 1 or worker 2, bike 2 to worker 2 or worker 1. Both assignments lead to sum of the Manhattan distances as 4.
Example 3:

Input: workers = [[0,0],[1,0],[2,0],[3,0],[4,0]], bikes = [[0,999],[1,999],[2,999],[3,999],[4,999]]
Output: 4995
 

Constraints:

N == workers.length
M == bikes.length
1 <= N <= M <= 10
workers[i].length == 2
bikes[i].length == 2
0 <= workers[i][0], workers[i][1], bikes[i][0], bikes[i][1] < 1000
All the workers and the bikes locations are unique.

## 10/12/2020 Permutation
```java
class Solution {
    
    Map<Integer, Integer> memo = new HashMap<>();
    int[][] workers;
    int[][] bikes;
    int n;
    int m;
    
    public int assignBikes(int[][] workers, int[][] bikes) {
        this.workers = workers;
        this.bikes = bikes;
        n = workers.length;
        m = bikes.length;
        return dfs(0, 0);
    }
    
    private int dfs(int index, int usedBikes) {
        // base case
        if (index == n) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        //computed result
        if (memo.containsKey(usedBikes)) {
            return memo.get(usedBikes);
        }
        
        int res = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        //pick any of the ununsed bikes for the current worker
        for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
            int bikeCode = (1 << j);
            if ((usedBikes & bikeCode) == 0) {
                res = Math.min(res, dfs(index + 1, usedBikes + bikeCode) + distance(workers[index], bikes[j]));
            }
        }
        memo.put(usedBikes, res);
        return res;
    }
    
    
    private int distance(int[] a, int[] b) {
        return Math.abs(a[0] - b[0]) + Math.abs(a[1] - b[1]);
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(Amn) the permutation of n elemetns out of m elemetns  
Space complexity: O(2 ^ m) for memo

## Notes
We need to try all possible solutions to see which one is the best. We utilize backtracking to permutate all the possible solutions. We also use memoization to store partial results so we don't do repeat computation.
