## Keyword
DFS, Backtracking

## Problem description
```
You have 4 cards each containing a number from 1 to 9. You need to judge whether they could operated through *, /, +, -, (, ) to get the value of 24.

Example 1:
Input: [4, 1, 8, 7]
Output: True
Explanation: (8-4) * (7-1) = 24
Example 2:
Input: [1, 2, 1, 2]
Output: False
Note:
The division operator / represents real division, not integer division. For example, 4 / (1 - 2/3) = 12.
Every operation done is between two numbers. In particular, we cannot use - as a unary operator. For example, with [1, 1, 1, 1] as input, the expression -1 - 1 - 1 - 1 is not allowed.
You cannot concatenate numbers together. For example, if the input is [1, 2, 1, 2], we cannot write this as 12 + 12.

## Complexity Analyze
\
Time complexity: O(1) Since total number of possibilites are limited\
Space complexity: O(1) 

## Notes
We simulate the computation process by picking two cards from the deck each time and compute the answer, then put it back. If any of the answer is correct, we will return true.
