## Keyword
DFS, backtracking

## Problem description
```
Given a binary tree where each path going from the root to any leaf form a valid sequence, check if a given string is a valid sequence in such binary tree. 

We get the given string from the concatenation of an array of integers arr and the concatenation of all values of the nodes along a path results in a sequence in the given binary tree.

 

Example 1:



Input: root = [0,1,0,0,1,0,null,null,1,0,0], arr = [0,1,0,1]
Output: true
Explanation: 
The path 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 is a valid sequence (green color in the figure). 
Other valid sequences are: 
0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0 
0 -> 0 -> 0
Example 2:



Input: root = [0,1,0,0,1,0,null,null,1,0,0], arr = [0,0,1]
Output: false 
Explanation: The path 0 -> 0 -> 1 does not exist, therefore it is not even a sequence.
Example 3:



Input: root = [0,1,0,0,1,0,null,null,1,0,0], arr = [0,1,1]
Output: false
Explanation: The path 0 -> 1 -> 1 is a sequence, but it is not a valid sequence.
 

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 5000
0 <= arr[i] <= 9
Each node's value is between [0 - 9].

        if(root == null) return false;
        //we reach a leaf and it is the last index of arr
        if(root.left == null && root.right == null && curr == arr.length - 1){
            return root.val == arr[curr];
        }
        //if we reach a leaf or it is the last index of arr
        if((root.left == null && root.right == null) || curr == arr.length - 1){
            return false;
        }
        
        //check the curren level
        if(root.val != arr[curr]){
            return false;
        }
        
        //divide and conquer
        return dfs(root.left, arr, curr + 1) || dfs(root.right, arr, curr + 1);
    }
}

## Complexity Analyze
DFS\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(h)

## Notes
Use backtracking to traverse through the entire tree to find out if the string exists in the tree
