## Keyword
DFS, BFS

## Problem description
```
Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.

A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

Example:

X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X
After running your function, the board should be:

X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X
Explanation:

Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'. Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.

```java
class Solution {
    int[] dir;
    int m;
    int n;
    public void solve(char[][] board) {
        m = board.length;
        if (m == 0) {
            return;
        }
        n = board[0].length;
        dir = new int[] {0, 1, 0, -1, 0};
        //find all board connected 'O'and mark them to 'B'
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            dfs(board, i, 0, 'O', 'B');
            if (n > 1) {
                dfs(board, i, n - 1, 'O', 'B');
            }
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            dfs(board, 0, j, 'O', 'B');
            if (m > 1) {
                dfs(board, m - 1, j, 'O', 'B');
            }
        }
        //change other 'O' to be 'X' and 'B' back to 'O'
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (board[i][j] == 'O') {
                    board[i][j] = 'X';
                } else if (board[i][j] == 'B') {
                    board[i][j] = 'O';
                }
            }
        }
    }
    private void dfs(char[][] board, int r, int c, char target, char end) {
        if (board[r][c] != target) {
            return;
        }
        board[r][c] = end;
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
            int nr = r + dir[i];
            int nc = c + dir[i + 1];
            if (nr < 0 || nc < 0 || nr >= m || nc >= n || board[nr][nc] != target) {
                continue;
            }
            dfs(board, nr, nc, target, end);
        }
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(m * n)\
Space complexity: O(m * n)

## Notes
Use DFS to change all board connected 'O' island to a temp value, then do a linear scan to change all 'O' to 'X' and temp value to 'X'.
