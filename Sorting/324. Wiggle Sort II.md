## Keyword
Array, Sorting

## Problem description
```
Given an unsorted array nums, reorder it such that nums[0] < nums[1] > nums[2] < nums[3]....

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1, 5, 1, 1, 6, 4]
Output: One possible answer is [1, 4, 1, 5, 1, 6].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1]
Output: One possible answer is [2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2].
Note:
You may assume all input has valid answer.

Can you do it in O(n) time and/or in-place with O(1) extra space?

## 3/3/2020 Sorting, index placement

```java
class Solution {
    public void wiggleSort(int[] nums) {
        //make a copy
        int[] copy = Arrays.copyOf(nums, nums.length);
        //sort the array
        Arrays.sort(copy);
        //place sorted elements back into the original array in an arranged manner, make sure the numbers near the median point are as far away from each other as possible
        int n = nums.length;
        int median = (nums.length + 1) / 2;
        //insert all even index elements
        for(int i = median - 1, j = 0; i >= 0; i--, j += 2){
            nums[j] = copy[i];
        }
        //insert all odd index elements
        for(int i = n - 1, j = 1; i >= median; i--, j += 2){
            nums[j] = copy[i];
        }
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Sorting and one pass placement\
Time complexity: O(nlogn)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
If we sort the input array into two halves, and put the smaller half into even indices and the bigger half into odd indices then we should have a wiggled array. The only problem here is that there might be duplicates near the median point. To make sure medians are as far away from each other as possible, we place the both halves into the corresponding indices in a descending manner.

## Complexity Analyze
Partition and one pass placement\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
We follow the same idea as the last solution, but instead of sorting the whole array, we only need to partition it into two halves, then make sure all duplicates median numbers are concurrent in the middle.
