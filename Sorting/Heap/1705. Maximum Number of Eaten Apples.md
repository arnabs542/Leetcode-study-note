## Problem description
```
There is a special kind of apple tree that grows apples every day for n days. On the ith day, the tree grows apples[i] apples that will rot after days[i] days, that is on day i + days[i] the apples will be rotten and cannot be eaten. On some days, the apple tree does not grow any apples, which are denoted by apples[i] == 0 and days[i] == 0.

You decided to eat at most one apple a day (to keep the doctors away). Note that you can keep eating after the first n days.

Given two integer arrays days and apples of length n, return the maximum number of apples you can eat.

 

Example 1:

Input: apples = [1,2,3,5,2], days = [3,2,1,4,2]
Output: 7
Explanation: You can eat 7 apples:
- On the first day, you eat an apple that grew on the first day.
- On the second day, you eat an apple that grew on the second day.
- On the third day, you eat an apple that grew on the second day. After this day, the apples that grew on the third day rot.
- On the fourth to the seventh days, you eat apples that grew on the fourth day.
Example 2:

Input: apples = [3,0,0,0,0,2], days = [3,0,0,0,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can eat 5 apples:
- On the first to the third day you eat apples that grew on the first day.
- Do nothing on the fouth and fifth days.
- On the sixth and seventh days you eat apples that grew on the sixth day.
 

Constraints:

apples.length == n
days.length == n
1 <= n <= 2 * 104
0 <= apples[i], days[i] <= 2 * 104
days[i] = 0 if and only if apples[i] = 0.
```
## 12/28/2020 Sorted Map
```java
class Solution {
    public int eatenApples(int[] apples, int[] days) {
        TreeMap<Integer, Integer> map = new TreeMap<>();
        int count = 0;
        for (int currentDay = 0; currentDay < apples.length || !map.isEmpty(); currentDay++) {
            // calculate the expiry of apples received on currentDay and update map
            if (currentDay < apples.length) {
                int currentExpiry = currentDay + days[currentDay];
                map.put(currentExpiry, map.getOrDefault(currentExpiry, 0) + apples[currentDay]);
            }
            // remove from map until if the expiry days have passed current day
            while (!map.isEmpty() && map.firstEntry().getKey() <= currentDay) {
                map.remove(map.firstEntry().getKey());
            }
            // eat an apple on current day
            if (!map.isEmpty()) {
                Integer latestExpiryDay = map.firstEntry().getKey();
                count++;
                if (map.get(latestExpiryDay) > 1)
                    map.put(latestExpiryDay, map.get(latestExpiryDay) - 1);
                else
                    map.remove(latestExpiryDay);
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(maxExpiryDay * log(maxExpiryDay))  
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Use tree map to store each expiry day's total number of apples. As we scan through the input, we add more apples and try to eat 1 per day. The key is to always eat the apple that is closet to expiry day.

## 12/28/2020 Array
```java
class Solution {
    public int eatenApples(int[] apples, int[] days) {
        int n = apples.length;
        int[] applesExpiry = new int[n + 20001];
        int count = 0;
        int lastDay = n;
        int latestExpiryPointer = 0;

        for (int currentDay = 0; currentDay < lastDay; currentDay++) {
            // calculate the expiry of apples received on currentDay and update map
            if (currentDay < n) {
                int currentExpiry = days[currentDay] + currentDay;
                applesExpiry[currentExpiry] += apples[currentDay];
                if (currentExpiry < latestExpiryPointer) latestExpiryPointer = currentExpiry;
                // update last day if current expiry is greater
                if (currentExpiry > lastDay) lastDay = currentExpiry;
            }
            while ((latestExpiryPointer <= currentDay ||
                    applesExpiry[latestExpiryPointer] == 0) &&
                   latestExpiryPointer < lastDay) {
                latestExpiryPointer++;
            }
           // eat an apple on current day
            if (applesExpiry[latestExpiryPointer] != 0) {
                applesExpiry[latestExpiryPointer]--;
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}

Time complexity: O(maxExpiryDay)  
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
We can use an extra array and pointers to keep track of the apples that are about to expire.
