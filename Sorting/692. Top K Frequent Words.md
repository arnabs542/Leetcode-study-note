## LeetCode link(Medium)
https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-words/

## Keyword
String, Sorting, Priority Queue

## Problem description
```
Given a non-empty list of words, return the k most frequent elements.

Your answer should be sorted by frequency from highest to lowest. If two words have the same frequency, then the word with the lower alphabetical order comes first.

Example 1:
Input: ["i", "love", "leetcode", "i", "love", "coding"], k = 2
Output: ["i", "love"]
Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
    Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.
Example 2:
Input: ["the", "day", "is", "sunny", "the", "the", "the", "sunny", "is", "is"], k = 4
Output: ["the", "is", "sunny", "day"]
Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words,
    with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.
Note:
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.
Input words contain only lowercase letters.
Follow up:
Try to solve it in O(n log k) time and O(n) extra space.

## 5/28/2020 HashMap and Priority Queue

```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> topKFrequent(String[] words, int k) {
        String[] ans = new String[k];
        //use hashmap to count all words
        Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (String word : words) {
            map.put(word, map.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);
        }
        //use a priority queue to keep most frequent k words
        PriorityQueue<String> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> {
            //compare frequency first
            if (map.get(a) != map.get(b)) {
                return map.get(a) - map.get(b);
            } else { //if same frequency, compare alphabetical order
                return b.compareTo(a);
            }
        });
        //iterate through all words
        for (String word : map.keySet()) {
            pq.add(word);
            if (pq.size() > k) {
                pq.poll();
            }
        }
        //extract strings into the answer list
        for (int i = k - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            ans[i] = pq.poll();
        }
        return new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(ans));
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Fixed-size priority queue\
Time complexity: O(nlogk)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
First we count every word's appearance. Then we use a fixed-size priority queue to extract top k elements out.

## Key points
Corner cases: when there's no meeting\
API: PriorityQueue.add(), PriorityQueue.poll(), Arrays.asList()
