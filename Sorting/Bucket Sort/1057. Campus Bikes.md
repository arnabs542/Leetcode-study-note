## Problem description
```
On a campus represented as a 2D grid, there are N workers and M bikes, with N <= M. Each worker and bike is a 2D coordinate on this grid.

Our goal is to assign a bike to each worker. Among the available bikes and workers, we choose the (worker, bike) pair with the shortest Manhattan distance between each other, and assign the bike to that worker. (If there are multiple (worker, bike) pairs with the same shortest Manhattan distance, we choose the pair with the smallest worker index; if there are multiple ways to do that, we choose the pair with the smallest bike index). We repeat this process until there are no available workers.

The Manhattan distance between two points p1 and p2 is Manhattan(p1, p2) = |p1.x - p2.x| + |p1.y - p2.y|.

Return a vector ans of length N, where ans[i] is the index (0-indexed) of the bike that the i-th worker is assigned to.

 

Example 1:



Input: workers = [[0,0],[2,1]], bikes = [[1,2],[3,3]]
Output: [1,0]
Explanation: 
Worker 1 grabs Bike 0 as they are closest (without ties), and Worker 0 is assigned Bike 1. So the output is [1, 0].
Example 2:



Input: workers = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,0]], bikes = [[1,0],[2,2],[2,1]]
Output: [0,2,1]
Explanation: 
Worker 0 grabs Bike 0 at first. Worker 1 and Worker 2 share the same distance to Bike 2, thus Worker 1 is assigned to Bike 2, and Worker 2 will take Bike 1. So the output is [0,2,1].
 

Note:

0 <= workers[i][j], bikes[i][j] < 1000
All worker and bike locations are distinct.
1 <= workers.length <= bikes.length <= 1000

    public int[] assignBikes(int[][] workers, int[][] bikes) {
        int m = workers.length;
        int n = bikes.length;
        int[] ans = new int[m];
        
        //create all pairs and sort them
        List<int[]> list = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                list.add(new int[] {i, j, distance(workers[i], bikes[j])});
            }
        }
        
        Collections.sort(list, (a, b) -> {
            if (a[2] != b[2]) {
                return a[2] - b[2];
            } else if (a[0] != b[0]) {
                return a[0] - b[0];
            } else {
                return a[1] - b[1];
            }
        });
        
        //pick pairs out
        boolean[] usedWorker = new boolean[m];
        boolean[] usedBike = new boolean[n];

        for (int[] pair : list) {
            if (!usedWorker[pair[0]] && !usedBike[pair[1]]) {
                ans[pair[0]] = pair[1];
                usedWorker[pair[0]] = true;
                usedBike[pair[1]] = true;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
    
    private int distance(int[] a, int[] b) {
        return Math.abs(a[0] - b[0]) + Math.abs(a[1] - b[1]);
    }

}

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(m * n * log(mn))  
Space complexity: O(m * n)

## Notes
We can sort all worker-bike pairs using the standards from the question. Then collect legal pairs one by one

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] assignBikes(int[][] workers, int[][] bikes) {
        // Notice that the Manhattan distance is between 0 and 2000,

        int[] wo = new int[w], bi = new int[b];
        List<int[]>[] dists = new List[2001];

                int dist = Math.abs(worker[0] - bike[0]) + Math.abs(worker[1] - bike[1]);

            for (int[] pair : dists[i]) {
                if (wo[pair[0]] == -1 && bi[pair[1]] == -1) {
                    wo[pair[0]] = pair[1];
                    bi[pair[1]] = pair[0];

## Complexity Analyze

Space complexity: O(m * n)

## Notes
Since input range is limited, we can use counting sort. Note if we visit pairs in the right way, their index is sorted in the right way as we want them in each bucket
