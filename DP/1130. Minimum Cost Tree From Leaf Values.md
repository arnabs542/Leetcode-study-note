DP

## Problem description
```
Given an array arr of positive integers, consider all binary trees such that:

Each node has either 0 or 2 children;
The values of arr correspond to the values of each leaf in an in-order traversal of the tree.  (Recall that a node is a leaf if and only if it has 0 children.)
The value of each non-leaf node is equal to the product of the largest leaf value in its left and right subtree respectively.
Among all possible binary trees considered, return the smallest possible sum of the values of each non-leaf node.  It is guaranteed this sum fits into a 32-bit integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [6,2,4]
Output: 32
Explanation:
There are two possible trees.  The first has non-leaf node sum 36, and the second has non-leaf node sum 32.

    24            24
   /  \          /  \
  12   4        6    8
 /  \               / \
6    2             2   4
 

Constraints:

2 <= arr.length <= 40
1 <= arr[i] <= 15
It is guaranteed that the answer fits into a 32-bit signed integer (ie. it is less than 2^31).

                    //any min sum that's not base case should be assigned MAX_VALUE

                    // the root product
                    int product = dp1[i][k] * dp1[k + 1][j];
                    // the minimum non-leaf sum for the range
                    dp2[i][j] = Math.min(dp2[i][j], dp2[i][k] + product + dp2[k + 1][j]);
                }
            }

Time complexity: O(n ^ 3)\
Space complexity: O(n ^ 2)

## Notes
Use DP1 to store the max number of a range [i, j] and DP2 to store the smallest possible sum of non-leaf node at a given range [i, j]. For each range of [i, j] the minimum non-leaf sum is the minimum of all possible division of the range into [i, k] and [k + 1, j] for left and right subtree.

## Notes
More straight forward solution, we use dp to store the max number of stone that can be acquired starting at any game.
