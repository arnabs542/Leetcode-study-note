## Keyword
DP, Greedy

## Problem description
```
Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

Example:

Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2.
    Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
Note:

You can assume that you can always reach the last index.

```java
class Solution {
    public int jump(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        //use dp array to store the min jumps to reach index i
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(dp, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        dp[0] = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {            
            for (int j = 1; j <= nums[i] && i + j < n; ++j) {
                dp[i + j] = Math.min(dp[i + j], dp[i] + 1);
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n - 1];
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n ^ 2)  
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Use dp array to store the minimum jumps to reach index i

## 10/06/2020 greedy
```java
class Solution {
  public int jump(int[] nums) {
    int n = nums.length;
    if (n < 2) return 0;

    // max position one could reach 
    // starting from index <= i 
    int maxPos = nums[0];
    // max number of steps one could do
    // inside this jump
    int maxSteps = nums[0];
    
    int jumps = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
      // if to reach this point 
      // one needs one more jump
      if (maxSteps < i) {
        ++jumps;
        maxSteps = maxPos;
      }
      maxPos = Math.max(maxPos, nums[i] + i);
    }
    return jumps;
  }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Use maxPos to store the max position that can be reached where index < i; maxSteps to store the max position that can be reached with jumps jump; jumps to store the current minimum jump. Whenever we cannot reach a new position, we need to have another jump which makes maxSteps = maxPos. We just need to keep updating maxPos, maxSteps and jumps along the way.
