## Problem description
```
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.

However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.

Example:

n = 10, I pick 8.

First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.

Game over. 8 is the number I picked.

You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.
Given a particular n â‰¥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.

```java
class Solution {
    public int getMoneyAmount(int n) {
        //use dp array to store the min cost to guess number in range [i, j]
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][n + 1];
        //for base case, when there's only 1 number or no number, we don't need to guess
        //iterate through all length
        for (int len = 2; len <= n; ++len) {
            //iterate through all range within length
            for (int i = 1, j = i + len - 1; j <= n; ++i, ++j) {
                //start the initial value as infinite
                dp[i][j] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
                //choose a pivot point, never guess the max number
                for (int guess = i; guess < j; ++guess) {
                    //pick the worst case possible for the current guessed number
                    int res = guess + Math.max(dp[i][guess - 1], dp[guess + 1][j]);
                    //update dp using the best scenario guess number
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], res);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[1][n];
    }
}

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n^3) \
Space complexity: O(n^2)

## Notes
For each range of numbers we need to guess, we can try to guess the first number in the range and the rest would be a smaller problem. The key here is to only go for the worst case for each guess number(maximum loss for each guess number), then find the best case guess number for the range(minimum of all maximum losses). This is a typical minimax problem where we minimize the maximum loss.
