## Problem description
```
There are N piles of stones arranged in a row.  The i-th pile has stones[i] stones.

A move consists of merging exactly K consecutive piles into one pile, and the cost of this move is equal to the total number of stones in these K piles.

Find the minimum cost to merge all piles of stones into one pile.  If it is impossible, return -1.

 

Example 1:

Input: stones = [3,2,4,1], K = 2
Output: 20
Explanation: 
We start with [3, 2, 4, 1].
We merge [3, 2] for a cost of 5, and we are left with [5, 4, 1].
We merge [4, 1] for a cost of 5, and we are left with [5, 5].
We merge [5, 5] for a cost of 10, and we are left with [10].
The total cost was 20, and this is the minimum possible.
Example 2:

Input: stones = [3,2,4,1], K = 3
Output: -1
Explanation: After any merge operation, there are 2 piles left, and we can't merge anymore.  So the task is impossible.
Example 3:

Input: stones = [3,5,1,2,6], K = 3
Output: 25
Explanation: 
We start with [3, 5, 1, 2, 6].
We merge [5, 1, 2] for a cost of 8, and we are left with [3, 8, 6].
We merge [3, 8, 6] for a cost of 17, and we are left with [17].
The total cost was 25, and this is the minimum possible.
 

Note:

1 <= stones.length <= 30
2 <= K <= 30
1 <= stones[i] <= 100

    public int mergeStones(int[] stones, int K) {
        //check if it is possible to merge stones
        int n = stones.length;
        if ((n - 1) % (K - 1) != 0) {

        }
        
        //use dp array to store the min cost to merge section [i, j] to be shorter than or equal to K

        //as for base case, dp[i][j] = 0; It's already 1 pile
        
        //compute all cases

            for (int l = 0, r = l + len - 1; r < n; ++l, ++r) {
                dp[l][r] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
                
                //split the subproblem into 1 pile on the left and some piles on the right that's smaller than K
                for (int mid = l; mid < r; mid += K - 1) {
                    dp[l][r] = Math.min(dp[l][r], dp[l][mid] + dp[mid + 1][r]);
                }
                
                //if the current group can be split into K piles, it means the right portion if the previous step must be K - 1
                //we need to merge these K piles into 1
                if ((len - 1) % (K - 1) == 0) {
                    dp[l][r] += prefix[r + 1] - prefix[l];
                }
            }
        }
        
        
        return dp[0][n - 1];
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n ^ 3 / K)  
Space complexity: O(n ^ 2)

## Notes
Use dp array to store the min cost to merge section [i, j] as much as possible. Fro any [i, j] we pick all possible mid points where [i, mid] will be merged into 1 pile, and thus dp[i, j] is equal to dp[i, mid] + dp[mid + 1, j] when dp[mid + 1, j] can be merged into less than K - 1 piles. In case [mid + 1, j] is merged into K - 1 piles, we need to merge [i, j] again into 1 pile.
