## Problem description
```
We have a collection of rocks, each rock has a positive integer weight.

Each turn, we choose any two rocks and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y.  The result of this smash is:

If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;
If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.
At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the smallest possible weight of this stone (the weight is 0 if there are no stones left.)

 

Example 1:

Input: [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
We can combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,7,1,8,1] then,
we can combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we can combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we can combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the optimal value.
 

Note:

1 <= stones.length <= 30
1 <= stones[i] <= 100
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int lastStoneWeightII(int[] stones) {
        //compute max possible sum
        int sum = 0;
        for (int s : stones){
            sum += s;
        }
        //use dp array to store if a final sum is possible to be made by smashing given amount of stones
        boolean[] dp = new boolean[sum * 2 + 1];
        //when there's no stone, sum of 0 is the only possibility
        dp[sum] = true;
        //for each loop, we add one more stone to create more possible sum
        for (int s : stones){
            //use rolling dp array to store the result of the new stone is added
            boolean[] dp2 = new boolean[sum * 2 + 1];
            //check every sum
            for (int i = 0; i <= sum * 2; ++i){
                //only compute the next sum if the current sum is possible
                if (dp[i]){
                    dp2[i + s] = true;
                    dp2[i - s] = true;
                }
            }
            //rotate two dp arrays
            dp = dp2;
        }
        //locate the smallest sum, note the offset
        for (int i = 0; i <= sum; ++i){
            if (dp[i + sum]) return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Use dp array to store if a final sum is possible to be made by smashing given amount of stones. For each outter loop, we add one more stone to create more possible sum.
