## Keyword
DP

## Problem description
```
Given a non-empty array containing only positive integers, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.

Note:

Each of the array element will not exceed 100.
The array size will not exceed 200.
 

Example 1:

Input: [1, 5, 11, 5]

Output: true

Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].
 

Example 2:

Input: [1, 2, 3, 5]

Output: false

Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canPartition(int[] nums) {
        //compute total sum
        int sum = 0;
        for (var i : nums){
            sum += i;
        }
        //corner case
        if (sum % 2 != 0){
            return false;
        }
        //use dp array to store if a number can be made up by the given integers so far
        boolean[] dp = new boolean[sum + 1];
        dp[0] = true;
        //add one integer into the pool for each loop
        for (var n : nums){
            //since all integers are positive, we can go backward in the sum to avoid reusing the same number.
            //we can also rotate two dp array to avoid resuing the same number
            for (int i = sum; i >= 0; --i){
                if (dp[i] && i + n <= sum){
                    dp[i + n] = true;
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[sum / 2];
    }
}
```

Time complexity: O(n * k)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Use dp array to store if a sum can be made up by the given integers in the pool so far. In the outer loop, we add one integer into the pool a time. In the inner loop, we update number's possibilities to be made up. Note that since we cannot reuse numbers, we can either go backward in the inner loop since all integers are positive. Or we can rotate two dp array.
