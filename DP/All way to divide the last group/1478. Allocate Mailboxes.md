DP, all ways to divide the last grouop

## Problem description
```
Given the array houses and an integer k. where houses[i] is the location of the ith house along a street, your task is to allocate k mailboxes in the street.

Return the minimum total distance between each house and its nearest mailbox.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

 

Example 1:



Input: houses = [1,4,8,10,20], k = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: Allocate mailboxes in position 3, 9 and 20.
Minimum total distance from each houses to nearest mailboxes is |3-1| + |4-3| + |9-8| + |10-9| + |20-20| = 5 
Example 2:



Input: houses = [2,3,5,12,18], k = 2
Output: 9
Explanation: Allocate mailboxes in position 3 and 14.
Minimum total distance from each houses to nearest mailboxes is |2-3| + |3-3| + |5-3| + |12-14| + |18-14| = 9.
Example 3:

Input: houses = [7,4,6,1], k = 1
Output: 8
Example 4:

Input: houses = [3,6,14,10], k = 4
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

n == houses.length
1 <= n <= 100
1 <= houses[i] <= 10^4
1 <= k <= n
Array houses contain unique integers.

    public int minDistance(int[] houses, int k) {
        int n = houses.length;
        Arrays.sort(houses);
        //compute cost for house in range [i, j]
        int[][] cost = new int[n][n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = i; j < n; ++j) {
                for (int t = i; t <= j; ++t) {
                    cost[i][j] += Math.abs(houses[(i + j) / 2] - houses[t]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        //use dp array to store the min cost to put i mailboxes for the first j houses
        int[][] dp = new int[k + 1][n];
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                //base case
                if (i == 1) {
                    dp[i][j] = cost[0][j];
                    continue;
                }
                dp[i][j] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
                for (int t = j; t >= i - 1; --t) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], cost[t][j] + dp[i - 1][t - 1]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[k][n - 1];
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n ^ 3)  
Space complexity: O(n ^ 2)

## Notes
A key observation here is that the best way to build 1 mail box for a group of houses is to pick the middle house. Thus our task is to divide houses into k groups. We first compute cost to place 1 mailbox for each group [i, j]. Then we use dp[i][j] to store min cost to place i mailboxes for the first j houses. Then try all ways to pick the last group.
