## Keyword
DP, multiple pass

## Problem description
```
There is an m by n grid with a ball. Given the start coordinate (i,j) of the ball, you can move the ball to adjacent cell or cross the grid boundary in four directions (up, down, left, right). However, you can at most move N times. Find out the number of paths to move the ball out of grid boundary. The answer may be very large, return it after mod 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: m = 2, n = 2, N = 2, i = 0, j = 0
Output: 6
Explanation:

Example 2:

Input: m = 1, n = 3, N = 3, i = 0, j = 1
Output: 12
Explanation:

 

Note:

Once you move the ball out of boundary, you cannot move it back.
The length and height of the grid is in range [1,50].
N is in range [0,50].

## 5/5/2020 DP, multiple pass

```java
class Solution {
    public int findPaths(int m, int n, int N, int i, int j) {
        int mod = 1000000007;
        int[] dir = new int[]{0, 1, 0, -1, 0};
        //use 2D dp array to store number of path leading to it at the current step
        int[][] dp = new int[m][n];
        dp[i][j] = 1;
        int count = 0;
        //for every step
        for (int k = 0; k < N; ++k){
            //another dp array to store results
            int[][] dp2 = new int[m][n];
            //for every cell
            for (int r = 0; r < m; ++r){
                for (int c = 0; c < n; ++c){
                    //for every possible directions
                    for (int d = 0; d < 4; ++d){
                        int nR = r + dir[d], nC = c + dir[d + 1];
                        //keep track of moves that go out of the board
                        if (nR < 0 || nR >= m || nC < 0 || nC >= n){
                            count = (count + dp[r][c]) % mod;
                        }
                        else {
                            dp2[nR][nC] = (dp2[nR][nC] + dp[r][c]) % mod;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            //update result
            dp = dp2;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Dp multiple pass\
Time complexity: O(m * n * N)\
Space complexity: O(m * n)

## Notes
Use DP to store number of path to reach every cell at the curren step. Then we compute the DP array for every step while keeping track of all path that leads to outside the board.
