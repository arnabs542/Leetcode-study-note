## Keyword
DP

## Problem description
```
Given a m * n matrix of ones and zeros, return how many square submatrices have all ones.

 

Example 1:

Input: matrix =
[
  [0,1,1,1],
  [1,1,1,1],
  [0,1,1,1]
]
Output: 15
Explanation: 
There are 10 squares of side 1.
There are 4 squares of side 2.
There is  1 square of side 3.
Total number of squares = 10 + 4 + 1 = 15.
Example 2:

Input: matrix = 
[
  [1,0,1],
  [1,1,0],
  [1,1,0]
]
Output: 7
Explanation: 
There are 6 squares of side 1.  
There is 1 square of side 2. 
Total number of squares = 6 + 1 = 7.
 

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 300
1 <= arr[0].length <= 300
0 <= arr[i][j] <= 1
```

        dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1];
        int square = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i <= m; ++i){
            for(int j = 1; j <= n; ++j){
                //when the current point is 1
                if(matrix[i - 1][j - 1] == 1){
                    //size of squares that can be formed is determined by top, top-left, left dp values
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(Math.min(dp[i - 1][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j]), dp[i][j - 1]) + 1;
                }
                //no new squares can be formed when the current point is 0
                else{
                    dp[i][j] = 0;
                }
                //update total squares
                square += dp[i][j];
            }
        }
        return square;
    }
}

Time complexity: O(m * n) \
Space complexity: O(m * n)

## Notes
Use dp array to store length of the side of a square ending at each point. This number also represents how many new squares can be formed

Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Since we compute dp row by row, we can use 1D to store previous values.
