## Keyword
DP, multiple pass

## Problem description
```
Given an integer n, your task is to count how many strings of length n can be formed under the following rules:

Each character is a lower case vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')
Each vowel 'a' may only be followed by an 'e'.
Each vowel 'e' may only be followed by an 'a' or an 'i'.
Each vowel 'i' may not be followed by another 'i'.
Each vowel 'o' may only be followed by an 'i' or a 'u'.
Each vowel 'u' may only be followed by an 'a'.
Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 1
Output: 5
Explanation: All possible strings are: "a", "e", "i" , "o" and "u".
Example 2:

Input: n = 2
Output: 10
Explanation: All possible strings are: "ae", "ea", "ei", "ia", "ie", "io", "iu", "oi", "ou" and "ua".
Example 3: 

Input: n = 5
Output: 68
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4
```

## 5/7/2020 DP, multiple pass

```java
class Solution {
    public int countVowelPermutation(int n) {
        int[][] rules = {{1}, {0, 2}, {0, 1, 3, 4}, {2, 4}, {0}};
        int MOD = 1000000007;
        //use dp array to store number of strings of a certain length ending at each vowel
        //a e i o u
        int[] dp = new int[5];
        //for length 1, it is possible to have 1 of each vowel as the ending character
        Arrays.fill(dp, 1);
        //we add the length by 1 for each loop
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i){
            //use rolling dp array to store results after adding the length
            int[] dp2 = new int[5];
            //compute new results ending at each vowel
            for (int j = 0; j < 5; ++j){
                for (int k : rules[j]){
                    dp2[k] = (dp2[k] + dp[j]) % MOD;
                }
            }
            //rotate dp arrays
            dp = dp2;
        }
        //add all possible string numbers
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i){
            count = (count + dp[i]) % MOD;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Dp multiple pass\
Time complexity: O(N)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Use DP to store number of strings of a certain length ending at each vowel. Then we add the length by 1 for each loop. At the end, we have to sum up all possible numbers of strings.
