## Problem description
```
Given two integer arrays arr1 and arr2, return the minimum number of operations (possibly zero) needed to make arr1 strictly increasing.

In one operation, you can choose two indices 0 <= i < arr1.length and 0 <= j < arr2.length and do the assignment arr1[i] = arr2[j].

If there is no way to make arr1 strictly increasing, return -1.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr1 = [1,5,3,6,7], arr2 = [1,3,2,4]
Output: 1
Explanation: Replace 5 with 2, then arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 6, 7].
Example 2:

Input: arr1 = [1,5,3,6,7], arr2 = [4,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Replace 5 with 3 and then replace 3 with 4. arr1 = [1, 3, 4, 6, 7].
Example 3:

Input: arr1 = [1,5,3,6,7], arr2 = [1,6,3,3]
Output: -1
Explanation: You can't make arr1 strictly increasing.
 

Constraints:

1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length <= 2000
0 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 10^9
```

## Notes
There are two status for the last number of the array: to swap it or to keep it. So we have to use two deep array, the 1D array for keepping the last number and 2D array for swapping the last number with a number from the second array. There are four status transition: 1. If the current number in the original array is larger than its previous number, we don't have to swap anything. 2. If the number from list 2 is larger than original array's previous number, swapping the last number to the number from list 2 will guarentee the increase property. 3. If the last number in the original array is larger than the number from list 2, only if we swapped a smaller or equal number of list2's last number with the previous number from the original array that we can have a increasing array. 4. If the previous number has been swapped with a smaller number than the last number from list 2, we can swap the current last number with the last number from list 2.\

Note that we should sort the second array and eliminate all duplicated numbers so we can keep track of min previous swap step as we interate through the row and don't need to use another loop to check for the min number.
