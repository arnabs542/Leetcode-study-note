## Problem description
```
There is a strange printer with the following two special requirements:

The printer can only print a sequence of the same character each time.
At each turn, the printer can print new characters starting from and ending at any places, and will cover the original existing characters.
Given a string consists of lower English letters only, your job is to count the minimum number of turns the printer needed in order to print it.

Example 1:
Input: "aaabbb"
Output: 2
Explanation: Print "aaa" first and then print "bbb".
Example 2:
Input: "aba"
Output: 2
Explanation: Print "aaa" first and then print "b" from the second place of the string, which will cover the existing character 'a'.
Hint: Length of the given string will not exceed 100.

        //default behavior, print everything else, then the last character
        dp[i][j] = helper(s, i, j - 1) + 1;
        //check if there are any characters that are the same as the last character
        for (int k = j - 1; k >= i; --k){
            if (s.charAt(k) == s.charAt(j)){
                dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], helper(s, i, k) + helper(s, k + 1, j - 1));
            }
        }

## Notes
Use dp array to store min step to print substring from i to j. For each substring [i, j], the default way to print it would be printing[i, j - 1] then + 1. But there could be ways to say printing steps if there are duplicated letters in the subarray. So we need to loop through the subarray to find letter k that's the same as the last letter, then we print subarray [i, k] + [k + 1, j - 1]. Here we skip the last letter because when we print letter k, we just run all the way to the end to cover letter j as well.
