String, DP

## Problem description
```
Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of S which equals T.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).

It's guaranteed the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.

Example 1:

Input: S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"
Output: 3
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

rabbbit
^^^^ ^^
rabbbit
^^ ^^^^
rabbbit
^^^ ^^^
Example 2:

Input: S = "babgbag", T = "bag"
Output: 5
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

babgbag
^^ ^
babgbag
^^    ^
babgbag
^    ^^
babgbag
  ^  ^^
babgbag
    ^^^

                    //the case when both string have last character removed and the case when only the source string has last character removed will contribute to the current case 
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + dp[i - 1][j];
                }
                //if the last character doesn't match
                else{
                    //it depends on the case when the source string has last character removed
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
                }

## Complexity Analyze
dp Bottom-Up\
Time complexity: O(m * n)\
Space complexity: O(m * n)

## Notes
We use dp array to store number of possible distinct subsequences for two substring of s and t. The result dp[i][j] depends on dp[i - 1][j] and dp[i - 1][j - 1] and the current last character.
