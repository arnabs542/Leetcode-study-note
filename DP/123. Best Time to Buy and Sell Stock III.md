DP

## Problem description
```
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:

Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
Example 2:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
Example 3:

Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int n = prices.length;
        if (n == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        //dp sell stores max possible profit that can be made when the sell date is on or before i
        int[] sell = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(sell, 0);
        int min = prices[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            sell[i] = Math.max(sell[i - 1], prices[i] - min);
            min = Math.min(min, prices[i]);
        }
        
        //dp buy stores max possible profit that can be made when buy date is on or after i
        int[] buy = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(buy, 0);
        int max = prices[n - 1];
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
            buy[i] = Math.max(buy[i + 1], max - prices[i]);
            max = Math.max(max, prices[i]);
        }
        
        //find the max profit
        int profit = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
            profit = Math.max(profit, sell[i] + buy[i + 1]);
        }
        return Math.max(sell[n - 1], Math.max(buy[0], profit));
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Get dp from both directions. Then look for the max when the two sections don't overlap. Note the max could occur when there's only 1 transaction.

```java

  public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
    int t1Cost = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    int t2Cost = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    int t1Profit = 0;
    int t2Profit = 0;

    for (int price : prices) {

        t2Profit = Math.max(t2Profit, price - t2Cost);
        t2Cost = Math.min(t2Cost, price - t1Profit);
        // the maximum profit if only one transaction is allowed
        t1Profit = Math.max(t1Profit, price - t1Cost);
        t1Cost = Math.min(t1Cost, price);

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
There are 4 states that form a state machine. We can use 4 variables to store each machine's previous best state and perform transform between different states.
