## Problem description
```
The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.

Given a non-negative integer n representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.

Example 1:

Input: 2
Output: [0,1,3,2]
Explanation:
00 - 0
01 - 1
11 - 3
10 - 2

For a given n, a gray code sequence may not be uniquely defined.
For example, [0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence.

00 - 0
10 - 2
11 - 3
01 - 1
Example 2:

Input: 0
Output: [0]
Explanation: We define the gray code sequence to begin with 0.
             A gray code sequence of n has size = 2n, which for n = 0 the size is 20 = 1.
             Therefore, for n = 0 the gray code sequence is [0].

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> grayCode(int n) {
        //use dp array to store a possible code sequence for number i
        List<Integer>[] dp = new ArrayList[n + 1];
        //base case
        dp[0] = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(0));
        //compute each gray code sequence
        for(int i = 1; i <= n; ++i){
            //initialize the list
            //all sequence of the previous gray code is half of the sequence of the current gray code
            dp[i] = new ArrayList<>(dp[i - 1]);
            //for the other half, we need to switch the current digit to 1 then change all other digits in the revsered order of the previous gray code
            for(int j = dp[i - 1].size() - 1; j >= 0; --j){
                dp[i].add((1 << (i - 1)) | dp[i - 1].get(j));
            }
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```

Space complexity: O(2^n)

## Notes
Use linear DP arrays to store the sequence of each gray code number. For number i, all sequence from i - 1 can be the first half for the i's sequence. Then we can change the i digit to 1 and reverse i - 1's sequence to change all the digits back, which will be the other half of the i's sequence.
