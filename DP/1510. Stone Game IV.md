## Problem description
```
Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there are n stones in a pile.  On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of removing any non-zero square number of stones in the pile.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, he/she loses the game.

Given a positive integer n. Return True if and only if Alice wins the game otherwise return False, assuming both players play optimally.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: Alice can remove 1 stone winning the game because Bob doesn't have any moves.
Example 2:

Input: n = 2
Output: false
Explanation: Alice can only remove 1 stone, after that Bob removes the last one winning the game (2 -> 1 -> 0).
Example 3:

Input: n = 4
Output: true
Explanation: n is already a perfect square, Alice can win with one move, removing 4 stones (4 -> 0).
Example 4:

Input: n = 7
Output: false
Explanation: Alice can't win the game if Bob plays optimally.
If Alice starts removing 4 stones, Bob will remove 1 stone then Alice should remove only 1 stone and finally Bob removes the last one (7 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0). 
If Alice starts removing 1 stone, Bob will remove 4 stones then Alice only can remove 1 stone and finally Bob removes the last one (7 -> 6 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0).
Example 5:

Input: n = 17
Output: false
Explanation: Alice can't win the game if Bob plays optimally.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^5

        if (memo[n] != null) {
            return memo[n];
        }
        
        boolean res = false;
        
        for (long i = 1; i * i <= (long)n; ++i) {
            if (!dfs(n - (int)(i * i))) {
                res = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        
        memo[n] = res;
        return res;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n * n^(1/2))  
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
DFS + Memo. Memo stores if one can win a game starting with i stones
