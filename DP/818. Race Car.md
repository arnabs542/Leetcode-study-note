## Problem description
```
Your car starts at position 0 and speed +1 on an infinite number line.  (Your car can go into negative positions.)

Your car drives automatically according to a sequence of instructions A (accelerate) and R (reverse).

When you get an instruction "A", your car does the following: position += speed, speed *= 2.

When you get an instruction "R", your car does the following: if your speed is positive then speed = -1 , otherwise speed = 1.  (Your position stays the same.)

For example, after commands "AAR", your car goes to positions 0->1->3->3, and your speed goes to 1->2->4->-1.

Now for some target position, say the length of the shortest sequence of instructions to get there.

Example 1:
Input: 
target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The shortest instruction sequence is "AA".
Your position goes from 0->1->3.
Example 2:
Input: 
target = 6
Output: 5
Explanation: 
The shortest instruction sequence is "AAARA".
Your position goes from 0->1->3->7->7->6.
 

Note:

1 <= target <= 10000.

    private int helper(int target){
        //if the min step to reach target is already computed, return it
        if(dp[target] != 0){
            return dp[target];
        }
        //compute step to pass or reach target is keep accelerating
        //for n steps, we will pass 2^n - 1 distance
        int n = (int)Math.ceil((Math.log(target + 1) / Math.log(2)));
        //if this is a perfect reach
        if((1 << n) == target + 1){
            dp[target] = n;
            return n;
        }
        //try reverse then go left to reach the target
        //AA...A (nA) best case
        dp[target] = n + 1 + helper((1 << n) - 1 - target);
        //try reverse 1 step a head, move a little, then reverse back to reach the target
        //AA...ARA...AR (n-1A + 1R + mA + 1R) + dp(left) 
        for(int m = 0; m < n - 1; ++m){
            int curr = (1 << (n - 1)) - (1 << m);
            dp[target] = Math.min(dp[target], n + m + 1 + helper(target - curr));
        }
        return dp[target];
    }
}

Time complexity: O(TlogT)\
Space complexity: O(T + logT)

## Notes
To reach the target, the best strategy would be 1. keep accelerating 2. go n steps to just pass the target, reverse then keep go to the target 3. go n - 1 to not reach the target, reverse, go m steps, then reverse again, and finally reach the target. This strategy is intuitive yet hard to prove.
