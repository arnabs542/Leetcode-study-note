## Problem description
```
Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,  return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

Example:

Input:  [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).

Follow up:
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {
        int[] res = new int[nums.length];
        res[0] = nums[0];
        //store all the product from the left
        for(int i = 1; i < nums.length - 1; i++){
            res[i] = nums[i] * res[i - 1];
        }
        //calculate result from the right
        int curProduct = 1;
        for(int i = nums.length - 1; i >= 1; i--){
            res[i] = res[i - 1] * curProduct;
            curProduct *= nums[i];
        }
        res[0] = curProduct;
        return res;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
two pass\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
To use no extra space, we have to store half of the solution in the output array itself.

## Key points
Corner cases:left most and right most result in the array\
