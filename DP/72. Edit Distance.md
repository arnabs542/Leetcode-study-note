## Problem description
```
Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

Insert a character
Delete a character
Replace a character
Example 1:

Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
Example 2:

Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
        int m = word1.length(), n = word2.length();
        //use a 2D dp array to store number of steps to change from substring ending in i to substring ending in j
        int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1];
        //set base case
        //it takes i step to change a length i string to empty string
        for(int i = 0; i <= m; ++i){
            dp[i][0] = i;
        }
        //it takes j step to change an empty string to a length j string
        for(int j = 0; j <= n; ++j){
            dp[0][j] = j;
        }
        //compute all possible way to change the word 1 to word 2 and all substring changes
        for(int i = 1; i <= m; ++i){
            for(int j = 1; j<= n; ++j){
                //if the the current two substrings end with same character, the step it will take to transfer would be to transfer without the last character
                if(word1.charAt(i - 1) == word2.charAt(j - 1)){
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                }
                else{
                    //to transfer the last digit, we can might: delete the last character, insert a new last character or replace the last character
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i - 1][j], Math.min(dp[i - 1][j - 1], dp[i][j - 1])) + 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[m][n];
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
DP Bottom-Up\
Time complexity: O(m * n)\
Space complexity: O(m * n)

## Notes
Use linear DP array to store min number of steps to change from substring ending in i to substring ending in j. If the last character is the same for both substring, the step it will take to transfer would be the same as to transfer without the last character. Otherwise, we need to make the last character match by deleting it, inserting a new one or replacing it.
