## Keyword
DP, multiple states

## Problem description
```
Say you have an array for which the i-th element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k transactions.

Note:
You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:

Input: [2,4,1], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
Example 2:

Input: [3,2,6,5,0,3], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4.
             Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int k, int[] prices) {
        int n = prices.length;

        // edge cases
        if (n <= 0 || k <= 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        //we can do as many transactions as we want, just find the max value
        if (2 * k >= n) {
            int res = 0;
            for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
                res += Math.max(0, prices[i] - prices[i - 1]);
            }
            return res;
        }

        // dp[transaction][day][ishold] = profit
        // ishold: 0 nothold, 1 hold
        int[][][] dp = new int[k + 1][n + 1][2];

        // base case
        for (int i = 0; i <= k; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
                // when transaction is 0, cannot have stocks and profit for without stack should be 0
                if (i == 0) {
                    dp[i][j][0] = 0;
                    dp[i][j][1] = -1000000000;
                }
                
                // when day is 0, cannot have stocks and profit for without stack should be 0
                if (j == 0) {
                    dp[i][j][0] = 0;
                    dp[i][j][1] = -1000000000;
                }
            }
        }

        // fill the array
        for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                // not holding
                dp[i][j][0] = Math.max(dp[i][j - 1][0], dp[i][j - 1][1] + prices[j - 1]);
                
                //holding
                dp[i][j][1] = Math.max(dp[i][j - 1][1], dp[i - 1][j - 1][0] - prices[j - 1]);
            }
        }
        
        //all days and transaction number available, not holding
        return dp[k][n][0];
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(k*n) if 2 * k < n; otherwise O(n)  
Space complexity: O(k*n) if 2 * k < n; otherwise O(1)

## Notes
Use dp array to store the max profit if we are allowed i transactions and first j days to trade and if we are holding stock or not: dp[trans][days][is_hold]. The current holding profit dp[trans][days][0] can come from either dp[trans][days - 1][0] or dp[trans][days - 1][1] + prices[j - 1]; The current not holding profit dp[trans][days][1] can come from either dp[trans][days - 1][1] or dp[trans - 1][days - 1][0] - prices[j - 1].  
For base case, at day 0 and transaction 0 we can only have 0 stocks and the profit is 0, we use -inf to mark the fact that we cannot have stocks.  
In the end, we should return dp[k][n][0] as if we are allowed to trade any days and at most k transactions and is not holding in the end.  
Also, if 2k is larger than n, it means we are allowed to trade however we want, we just need to find the max possible profit.
