## Problem description
```
Given an array nums of integers, you can perform operations on the array.

In each operation, you pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. After, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 or nums[i] + 1.

You start with 0 points. Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying such operations.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3, 4, 2]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
Delete 4 to earn 4 points, consequently 3 is also deleted.
Then, delete 2 to earn 2 points. 6 total points are earned.
 

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]
Output: 9
Explanation: 
Delete 3 to earn 3 points, deleting both 2's and the 4.
Then, delete 3 again to earn 3 points, and 3 again to earn 3 points.
9 total points are earned.
 

Note:

The length of nums is at most 20000.
Each element nums[i] is an integer in the range [1, 10000].

```java
class Solution {
    public int deleteAndEarn(int[] nums) {
        //store how many points can be made by every one of some number
        int[] total = new int[10001];
        for(var i : nums){
            total[i] += i;
        }
        //use two variables to cache max points that can be made at each number and its previous one
        int prevPoint = 0, currPoint = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < 10001; i++){
            int temp = currPoint;
            currPoint = Math.max(prevPoint + total[i], currPoint);
            prevPoint = temp;
        }
        return currPoint;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Bottom-Up DP 1D\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
If we take a number, we might as well take all copies of that number. Then we have to skip the previous and the post numbers. Thus the problem is reduced to house robber problem. We can use no extra space since we only keep track of 2 previous dp results.
