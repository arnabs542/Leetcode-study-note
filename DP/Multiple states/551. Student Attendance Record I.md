## Keyword
DP, multiple states

## Problem description
```
You are given a string representing an attendance record for a student. The record only contains the following three characters:
'A' : Absent.
'L' : Late.
'P' : Present.
A student could be rewarded if his attendance record doesn't contain more than one 'A' (absent) or more than two continuous 'L' (late).

You need to return whether the student could be rewarded according to his attendance record.

Example 1:
Input: "PPALLP"
Output: True
Example 2:
Input: "PPALLL"
Output: False

                lastLate = false;
                lastTwoLate = false;
                if (c == 'A') {
                    if (++absent > 1) {
                        return false;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return true;

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Use dp variable to store the states of continous 'L'
