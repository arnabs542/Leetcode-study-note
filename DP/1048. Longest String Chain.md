## Problem description
```
Given a list of words, each word consists of English lowercase letters.

Let's say word1 is a predecessor of word2 if and only if we can add exactly one letter anywhere in word1 to make it equal to word2.  For example, "abc" is a predecessor of "abac".

A word chain is a sequence of words [word_1, word_2, ..., word_k] with k >= 1, where word_1 is a predecessor of word_2, word_2 is a predecessor of word_3, and so on.

Return the longest possible length of a word chain with words chosen from the given list of words.

 

Example 1:

Input: ["a","b","ba","bca","bda","bdca"]
Output: 4
Explanation: one of the longest word chain is "a","ba","bda","bdca".
 

Note:

1 <= words.length <= 1000
1 <= words[i].length <= 16
words[i] only consists of English lowercase letters.

Time complexity: O(n^2 * l)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Use linear DP array to store word chain length when it ends at each word. The new index's word chain length can be calculated by traversing all previous elements to compare their values then update the DP array. In the process, we can use a variable to keep track of longest word chain length. Note that we have to sort all string by length first because the word chain can happen chain any words in the list together unlike the subsequence where we cannot change order, so sorting the input by length will make sure that the predcessors are always before the current word.

## Notes
We can use hashmap to store each string's dp result. Then for a new string, it's a lot faster to query for predecessors as we remove 1 character out of the new string a time.
