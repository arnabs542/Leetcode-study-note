## Problem description
```
Alex and Lee continue their games with piles of stones.  There are a number of piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones piles[i].  The objective of the game is to end with the most stones. 

Alex and Lee take turns, with Alex starting first.  Initially, M = 1.

On each player's turn, that player can take all the stones in the first X remaining piles, where 1 <= X <= 2M.  Then, we set M = max(M, X).

The game continues until all the stones have been taken.

Assuming Alex and Lee play optimally, return the maximum number of stones Alex can get.

 

Example 1:

Input: piles = [2,7,9,4,4]
Output: 10
Explanation:  If Alex takes one pile at the beginning, Lee takes two piles, then Alex takes 2 piles again. Alex can get 2 + 4 + 4 = 10 piles in total. If Alex takes two piles at the beginning, then Lee can take all three piles left. In this case, Alex get 2 + 7 = 9 piles in total. So we return 10 since it's larger. 
 

Constraints:

1 <= piles.length <= 100
1 <= piles[i] <= 10 ^ 4

            sum += piles[firstPile + i - 1];
            dp[M][firstPile] = Math.max(dp[M][firstPile], sum - helper(piles, firstPile + i, Math.max(i, M)));

}

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n ^ 3)\
Space complexity: O(n ^ 2)

## Notes
Use DP to store the best gain with first remaining stone pile i left and a number num within range. At each game condition, we try taking every possible number of piles and give the rest for the component to deal with by subtracting its gain. The max possible gain will be the answer for the current condition. For base cases, if we can take all the stone piles, we will.

## Notes
More straight forward solution, we use dp to store the max number of stone that can be acquired starting at any game.
