## Keyword
Greedy, DP, Two pointer, Binary search

## Problem description
```
From any string, we can form a subsequence of that string by deleting some number of characters (possibly no deletions).

Given two strings source and target, return the minimum number of subsequences of source such that their concatenation equals target. If the task is impossible, return -1.

 

Example 1:

Input: source = "abc", target = "abcbc"
Output: 2
Explanation: The target "abcbc" can be formed by "abc" and "bc", which are subsequences of source "abc".
Example 2:

Input: source = "abc", target = "acdbc"
Output: -1
Explanation: The target string cannot be constructed from the subsequences of source string due to the character "d" in target string.
Example 3:

Input: source = "xyz", target = "xzyxz"
Output: 3
Explanation: The target string can be constructed as follows "xz" + "y" + "xz".
 

Constraints:

Both the source and target strings consist of only lowercase English letters from "a"-"z".
The lengths of source and target string are between 1 and 1000.

## 09/28/2020 Two pointer
```java
class Solution {
    public int shortestWay(String source, String target) {
        //each time, use two pointers to grab as much letters from source in 1 run as possible to form some prefix of target string so far
        int m = source.length();
        int n = target.length();
        int count = 0;
        for (int t = 0, s = 0; t < target.length(); s = 0) {
            int matched = 0;
            while (s < m && t < n) {
                if (target.charAt(t) == source.charAt(s)) {
                    ++matched;
                    ++t;
                    ++s;
                } else {
                    ++s;
                }
            }
            if (matched == 0) {
                return -1;
            }
            ++count;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(m * n)  
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Use two pointers to greedily find the longest match of target from source. Then start over until target is formed

## 09/28/2020 Binary Search
```java
class Solution {
    public int shortestWay(String source, String target) {
        char[] cs = source.toCharArray(), ts = target.toCharArray();
        int res = 1;
        List<Integer>[] idx = new List[26];
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) idx[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < cs.length; i++) idx[cs[i] - 'a'].add(i);
        int j = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < ts.length; ) {
            List<Integer> tar = idx[ts[i] - 'a'];
            if (tar.isEmpty()) return -1;
            int k = Collections.binarySearch(tar,j);
            if (k < 0) k = -k - 1;
            if (k == tar.size()) {
                res++;
                j = 0;
            } else {
                j = tar.get(k) + 1;
                i++;
            }

        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(log(m) * n)  
Space complexity: O(m)

## Notes
Store each letter's position in source string. Then we need to find the next x character in source, we can use binary search to find it.

        int[][] idx = new int[26][cs.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < cs.length; i++) idx[cs[i] - 'a'][i] = i + 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            for (int j = cs.length - 1, pre = 0; j >= 0; j--) {
                if (idx[i][j] == 0) idx[i][j] = pre;
                else pre = idx[i][j];

            j = idx[ts[i] - 'a'][j];
            if (j == 0 ) {
                res++;
                i--;
            }
        }
        return  res;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(m)

## Notes
Instead of storing each character's index in source, we can use dp arrays to store the next index of character 'x' if the current index is at i. This will cost use O(m * 26) in space. This way we can query the next index in O(1).
