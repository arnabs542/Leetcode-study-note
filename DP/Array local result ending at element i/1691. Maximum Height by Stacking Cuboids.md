## Problem description
```
Given n cuboids where the dimensions of the ith cuboid is cuboids[i] = [widthi, lengthi, heighti] (0-indexed). Choose a subset of cuboids and place them on each other.

You can place cuboid i on cuboid j if widthi <= widthj and lengthi <= lengthj and heighti <= heightj. You can rearrange any cuboid's dimensions by rotating it to put it on another cuboid.

Return the maximum height of the stacked cuboids.

 

Example 1:



Input: cuboids = [[50,45,20],[95,37,53],[45,23,12]]
Output: 190
Explanation:
Cuboid 1 is placed on the bottom with the 53x37 side facing down with height 95.
Cuboid 0 is placed next with the 45x20 side facing down with height 50.
Cuboid 2 is placed next with the 23x12 side facing down with height 45.
The total height is 95 + 50 + 45 = 190.
Example 2:

Input: cuboids = [[38,25,45],[76,35,3]]
Output: 76
Explanation:
You can't place any of the cuboids on the other.
We choose cuboid 1 and rotate it so that the 35x3 side is facing down and its height is 76.
Example 3:

Input: cuboids = [[7,11,17],[7,17,11],[11,7,17],[11,17,7],[17,7,11],[17,11,7]]
Output: 102
Explanation:
After rearranging the cuboids, you can see that all cuboids have the same dimension.
You can place the 11x7 side down on all cuboids so their heights are 17.
The maximum height of stacked cuboids is 6 * 17 = 102.
 

Constraints:

n == cuboids.length
1 <= n <= 100
1 <= widthi, lengthi, heighti <= 100

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxHeight(int[][] cuboids) {
        int n = cuboids.length;
        //sort each cuboid by its side length
        for (int[] cuboid : cuboids) {
            Arrays.sort(cuboid);
        }
        
        //sort all cuboids so that cuboids i is only able to be placed on some cuboids j when j < i
        Arrays.sort(cuboids, (a, b) -> {
            if (a[0] != b[0]) {
                return Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]);
            }
            if (a[1] != b[1]) {
                return Integer.compare(a[1], b[1]);
            }
            return Integer.compare(a[2], b[2]);
        });
        
        //LIS problem
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        int max = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            //always make the cuboid "stand up"
            dp[i] = cuboids[i][2];

            for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
                if (cuboids[j][0] <= cuboids[i][0] && cuboids[j][1] <= cuboids[i][1] && cuboids[j][2] <= cuboids[i][2]) {
                    dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], cuboids[i][2] + dp[j]);
                }
            }
            max = Math.max(max, dp[i]);
        }
        
        return max;
    }
}

```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n ^ 2)  
Space complexity: O(n ^ 2)

## Notes
A cuboid can only be placed on another cuboid for a very strict rule. So we can sort all cuboid in a way that only some or no cuboid j where j < i that i can be placed on j. Then the problem becomes LIS problem. Note an important optimization is that since a cuboid can only be placed on another when all tree dimensions satisfy the smaller or equal rule, in the final combination of cuboids we can always make everything stand on its smallest face so the overall height is taller. Thus during the algorithm we always keep all cuboids stand on its smallest face.
