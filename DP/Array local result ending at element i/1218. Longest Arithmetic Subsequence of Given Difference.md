## Problem description
```
Given an integer array arr and an integer difference, return the length of the longest subsequence in arr which is an arithmetic sequence such that the difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence equals difference.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], difference = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [1,2,3,4].
Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,3,5,7], difference = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is any single element.
Example 3:

Input: arr = [1,5,7,8,5,3,4,2,1], difference = -2
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [7,5,3,1].
 

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 10^5
-10^4 <= arr[i], difference <= 10^4
```
## 4/23/2020 DP Sequence length which ends at current number

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestSubsequence(int[] arr, int difference) {
        //use hashmap to cache arithmetic sequence length ending at each number
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int max = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
            //if there is a predecessor, the current number should extend that sequence
            map.put(arr[i], map.getOrDefault(arr[i] - difference, 0) + 1);
            max = Math.max(map.get(arr[i]), max);
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Use hash map to cache for each number in the array, we can cache the length of a arithmetic sequence's length ending at it. To compute this length, we can query the if the last number (arr[i] - difference) exists in the hashmap and use its length + 1.
