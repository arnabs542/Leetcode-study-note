DP, Backtracking

## Problem description
```
You are given two groups of points where the first group has size1 points, the second group has size2 points, and size1 >= size2.

The cost of the connection between any two points are given in an size1 x size2 matrix where cost[i][j] is the cost of connecting point i of the first group and point j of the second group. The groups are connected if each point in both groups is connected to one or more points in the opposite group. In other words, each point in the first group must be connected to at least one point in the second group, and each point in the second group must be connected to at least one point in the first group.

Return the minimum cost it takes to connect the two groups.

 

Example 1:


Input: cost = [[15, 96], [36, 2]]
Output: 17
Explanation: The optimal way of connecting the groups is:
1--A
2--B
This results in a total cost of 17.
Example 2:


Input: cost = [[1, 3, 5], [4, 1, 1], [1, 5, 3]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The optimal way of connecting the groups is:
1--A
2--B
2--C
3--A
This results in a total cost of 4.
Note that there are multiple points connected to point 2 in the first group and point A in the second group. This does not matter as there is no limit to the number of points that can be connected. We only care about the minimum total cost.
Example 3:

Input: cost = [[2, 5, 1], [3, 4, 7], [8, 1, 2], [6, 2, 4], [3, 8, 8]]
Output: 10
 

Constraints:

size1 == cost.length
size2 == cost[i].length
1 <= size1, size2 <= 12
size1 >= size2
0 <= cost[i][j] <= 100

## 11/09/2020 DP, Backtracking
```java
class Solution {
    
    int[][] dp;
    
    public int connectTwoGroups(List<List<Integer>> cost) {
        int m = cost.size();
        int n = cost.get(0).size();
        
        // use dp array to store minimum cost to have all nodes connected where the first i nodes in group A are already connected and the group B's current connection status is j
        dp = new int[m + 1][(1<<n)];
        
        // store minimum cost to connect a point in group B
        int[] minSecondGroup = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(minSecondGroup, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                minSecondGroup[j] = Math.min(minSecondGroup[j], cost.get(i).get(j));
            }
        }
        
        return helper(cost, 0, minSecondGroup, 0);
    }
    
    private int helper(List<List<Integer>> cost, int i, int[] minSecondGroup, int mask) {
        if (dp[i][mask] > 0) return dp[i][mask];
        
        int res = 0;
        if (i < cost.size()) {
            res = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            for (int j = 0; j < cost.get(0).size(); j++) {
                res = Math.min(res, cost.get(i).get(j) + helper(cost, i + 1, minSecondGroup, mask | (1 << j)));
            }
        } else {
            for (int j = 0; j < cost.get(0).size(); j++) {
                if ((mask & (1 << j)) == 0) res += minSecondGroup[j];
            }
        }
        return dp[i][mask] = res;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n * 2 ^ n)  
Space complexity: O(n * 2 ^ n)

## Notes
We use dp array to to store minimum cost to have all nodes connected where the first i nodes in group A are already connected and the group B's current connection status is j. We use another array to store the minimum cost to connect a group B node to group A. Then with backtracking and memoization, we can find the minimum cost to connect all nodes on the left side where group B's connection status is a combination. Then we can try to greedily connect all remaining nodes in group B with minimum cost.
