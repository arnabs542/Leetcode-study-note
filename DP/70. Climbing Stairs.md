## Keyword
DP

## Problem description
```
You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Note: Given n will be a positive integer.

Example 1:

Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
Example 2:

Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

            return DP[n];

            return 1;
        }
        //current step depends on previous 2 stairs
        DP[n] = helper(n - 1) + helper(n - 2);
        return DP[n];
    }

Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Same as above, but we can use no extra space since we only need to keep track of 2 previous step counts
