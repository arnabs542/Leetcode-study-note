## Keyword
DP

## Problem description
```
Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.

Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of s.

Example:

Input: "aab"
Output: 1
Explanation: The palindrome partitioning ["aa","b"] could be produced using 1 cut.

```java
class Solution {
    public int minCut(String s) {
        char[] c = s.toCharArray();
        int n = c.length;
        //use dp array to store min number of cuts need to partition substring [0, i] into palindromes
        int[] cut = new int[n];
        //another dp array to store if a substring [i, j] is a palindromes
        boolean[][] pal = new boolean[n][n];
        
        //for every substring that starts from the front
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            //the max number of cuts is i where we cut the substring into single characters
            cut[i] = i;
            //for every possible start index of the rightmost partition
            for(int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
                //if the rightmost partition is a palindrome
                if(c[j] == c[i] && (j + 1 > i - 1 || pal[j + 1][i - 1])) {
                    //record this palindrome
                    pal[j][i] = true;
                    //update the min cuts for the current substring if applicable
                    //special case when j is 0: we don't need any cut in this case
                    cut[i] = j == 0 ? 0 : Math.min(cut[i], cut[j - 1] + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        return cut[n - 1];
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
DP\
Time complexity: O(n ^ 2)\
Space complexity: O(n ^ 2)

## Notes
Use dp array to store min number of cuts need to partition substring [0, i] into palindromes and another dp array to store if a substring [i, j] is a palindromes. Then we start to fill the dp array by finding out each possible rightmost partition, then use computed results to calculate the minimum needed to partition the current entire substring.
