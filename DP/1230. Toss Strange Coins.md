## Keyword
DP, multiple pass

## Problem description
```
You have some coins.  The i-th coin has a probability prob[i] of facing heads when tossed.

Return the probability that the number of coins facing heads equals target if you toss every coin exactly once.

 

Example 1:

Input: prob = [0.4], target = 1
Output: 0.40000
Example 2:

Input: prob = [0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5], target = 0
Output: 0.03125
 

Constraints:

1 <= prob.length <= 1000
0 <= prob[i] <= 1
0 <= target <= prob.length
Answers will be accepted as correct if they are within 10^-5 of the correct answer.

## 5/8/2020 DP, multiple pass

```java
class Solution {
    public double probabilityOfHeads(double[] prob, int target) {
        //the number of coin is the max possible sum
        int n = prob.length;
        //use dp array to store the possibilities to get to any sum with some amounts of coins
        double[] dp = new double[n + 1];
        //base case, when there's no coin, it's 100% chance to get sum of 0
        dp[0] = 1;
        //compute for each coin to be added in
        for (double chance : prob){
            //use another dp array to cache the result after the coin is added
            double[] dp2 = new double[n + 1];
            //compute for all sum
            for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i){
                //only if the previous sum has a chance to be reached, can we compute the next possible sum
                if (dp[i] != 0){
                    dp2[i] += dp[i] * (1 - chance);
                    dp2[i + 1] += dp[i] * chance;
                }
            }
            //rotate results
            dp = dp2;
        }
        return dp[target];
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Dp multiple pass\
Time complexity: O(n * p)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Use DP to store the possibilities to get to any sum with some amounts of coins. Then we add each coin in for each loop.
