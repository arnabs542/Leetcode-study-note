## Problem description
```
You want to schedule a list of jobs in d days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To work on the i-th job, you have to finish all the jobs j where 0 <= j < i).

You have to finish at least one task every day. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the d days. The difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done in that day.

Given an array of integers jobDifficulty and an integer d. The difficulty of the i-th job is jobDifficulty[i].

Return the minimum difficulty of a job schedule. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs return -1.

 

Example 1:


Input: jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: First day you can finish the first 5 jobs, total difficulty = 6.
Second day you can finish the last job, total difficulty = 1.
The difficulty of the schedule = 6 + 1 = 7 
Example 2:

Input: jobDifficulty = [9,9,9], d = 4
Output: -1
Explanation: If you finish a job per day you will still have a free day. you cannot find a schedule for the given jobs.
Example 3:

Input: jobDifficulty = [1,1,1], d = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The schedule is one job per day. total difficulty will be 3.
Example 4:

Input: jobDifficulty = [7,1,7,1,7,1], d = 3
Output: 15
Example 5:

Input: jobDifficulty = [11,111,22,222,33,333,44,444], d = 6
Output: 843
 

Constraints:

1 <= jobDifficulty.length <= 300
0 <= jobDifficulty[i] <= 1000
1 <= d <= 10
```


## 5/10/2020 DP Bottom-Up

```java
class Solution {
    public int minDifficulty(int[] jobDifficulty, int d) {
        int n = jobDifficulty.length;
        //when we don't have enough days
        if (n < d){
            return -1;
        }
        //use dp array to store the minimum difficulty if we have i days and first j jobs
        int[][] dp = new int[d + 1][n + 1];
        //prefill with max number
        for (int i = 1; i <= d; ++i){
            Arrays.fill(dp[i], Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2);
        }
        //for base cases, if there's only 1 day, the min difficulty is the most difficulty job out of all jobs
        int max = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i){
            max = Math.max(max, jobDifficulty[i - 1]);
            dp[1][i] = max;
        }
        //compute for all cases
        //for each number of days
        for (int i = 2; i <= d; ++i){
            //for each number of total tasks
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j){
                //the current most difficult task in the last day
                int currMax = 0;
                //for each last day's number of task
                for (int task = 1; task <= j - i + 1; ++task){
                    currMax = Math.max(currMax, jobDifficulty[j - task]);
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], currMax + dp[i - 1][j - task]);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[d][n];
    }
}

## Complexity Analyze
Bottom-Up DP\
Time complexity: O(n^2 * K)\
Space complexity: O(n^2)

## Notes
Use dp array to store the minimum difficulty if we have i days and first j jobs. For each row i, the results rely on row i - 1's results.

## Key points
Corner cases: if number of jobs is less than number of days\
