DP

## Problem description
```
Given an integer array arr, in one move you can select a palindromic subarray arr[i], arr[i+1], ..., arr[j] where i <= j, and remove that subarray from the given array. Note that after removing a subarray, the elements on the left and on the right of that subarray move to fill the gap left by the removal.

Return the minimum number of moves needed to remove all numbers from the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [1,2]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,3,4,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: Remove [4] then remove [1,3,1] then remove [5].
 

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 100
1 <= arr[i] <= 20
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumMoves(int[] arr) {
        //use dp array to store minimum moves of range [i, j]
        int n = arr.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n][n];
        //base case, len 1 range needs 1 remove, len 2 range needs 1 or 2 removes
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            dp[i][i] = 1;
            if (i + 1 < n) {
                dp[i][i + 1] = arr[i] == arr[i + 1] ? 1 : 2;
            }
        }
        
        //compute all other cases
        for (int len = 3; len <= n; ++len) {
            for (int l = 0, r = l + len - 1; r < n; ++l, ++r) {
                if (arr[l] == arr[r]) { //when the first and last character are the same
                    dp[l][r] = dp[l + 1][r - 1];
                } else {
                    dp[l][r] = dp[l + 1][r - 1] + 2;
                }
                //try dividng the current range into two and remove each
                for (int k = l; k < r; ++k) {
                    dp[l][r] = Math.min(dp[l][r], dp[l][k] + dp[k + 1][r]);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[0][n - 1];
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n ^ 3)\
Space complexity: O(n ^ 2)

## Notes
Length 1 and length 2 ranges are the base cases. Then for all other cases: if the first and last character are the same, the times to remove range[i, j] could be at least the same times for range[i + 1, j - 1]. Other wise it could at least be range[i + 1, j - 1] + 2. Then we try to divide the range into any two parts to remove separately: [i, k] and [k + 1, j] and maybe it will take less moves.
