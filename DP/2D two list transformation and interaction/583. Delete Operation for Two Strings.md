https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-operation-for-two-strings/

## Keyword
String, DP

## Problem description
```
Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps required to make word1 and word2 the same, where in each step you can delete one character in either string.

Example 1:
Input: "sea", "eat"
Output: 2
Explanation: You need one step to make "sea" to "ea" and another step to make "eat" to "ea".
Note:
The length of given words won't exceed 500.
Characters in given words can only be lower-case letters.
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
        int m = word1.length(), n = word2.length();
        //use dp array to store the min steps to delete at each substring pairs
        int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1];
        //base cases
        //first row and first colum are for if one of the substring is empty. We have to delete the entire other substring
        for (int i = 0; i <= m; ++i){
            dp[i][0] = i;
        }
        for (int j = 0; j <= n; ++j){
            dp[0][j] = j;
        }
        //compute results for each substring pair
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i){
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j){
                //if the last character match, then we don't need to delete extra characters compared to the substrings without the last character
                if (word1.charAt(i - 1) == word2.charAt(j - 1)){
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                }
                //otherwise, we need to find the minimum of two smaller substirng pair's result and add the extra step to delete one of the last character.
                else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]) + 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[m][n];
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(m * n)\
Space complexity: O(m * n)

## Notes
We use dp array to store min steps to delete at each substring pairs of the original strings.
