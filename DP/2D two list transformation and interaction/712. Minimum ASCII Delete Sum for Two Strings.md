## Problem description
```
Given two strings s1, s2, find the lowest ASCII sum of deleted characters to make two strings equal.

Example 1:
Input: s1 = "sea", s2 = "eat"
Output: 231
Explanation: Deleting "s" from "sea" adds the ASCII value of "s" (115) to the sum.
Deleting "t" from "eat" adds 116 to the sum.
At the end, both strings are equal, and 115 + 116 = 231 is the minimum sum possible to achieve this.
Example 2:
Input: s1 = "delete", s2 = "leet"
Output: 403
Explanation: Deleting "dee" from "delete" to turn the string into "let",
adds 100[d]+101[e]+101[e] to the sum.  Deleting "e" from "leet" adds 101[e] to the sum.
At the end, both strings are equal to "let", and the answer is 100+101+101+101 = 403.
If instead we turned both strings into "lee" or "eet", we would get answers of 433 or 417, which are higher.
Note:

0 < s1.length, s2.length <= 1000.
All elements of each string will have an ASCII value in [97, 122].

    public int minimumDeleteSum(String s1, String s2) {
        int m = s1.length(), n = s2.length();
        //use dp array to store the min ASCII to delete at each substring pairs
        int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1];
        //base cases
        //first row and first colum are for if one of the substring is empty. We have to delete the entire other substring
        dp[0][0] = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i){
            dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0] + (int)s1.charAt(i - 1);

            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1] + (int)s2.charAt(j - 1);
        }
        //compute results for each substring pair
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i){
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j){
                //if the last character match, then we don't need to delete extra characters compared to the substrings without the last character
                if (s1.charAt(i - 1) == s2.charAt(j - 1)){
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                }
                //otherwise, we need to find the minimum of two smaller substirng pair's result plus the ascii code of corresponding letter to delete
                else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i - 1][j] + (int)s1.charAt(i - 1), dp[i][j - 1] + (int)s2.charAt(j - 1));
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[m][n];
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(m * n)\
Space complexity: O(m * n)

## Notes
We use dp array to store min ascii sum to delete at each substring pairs of the original strings.
