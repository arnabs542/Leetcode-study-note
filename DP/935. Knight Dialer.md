## Keyword
DP, multiple pass

## Problem description
```
A chess knight can move as indicated in the chess diagram below:

 .           

 

This time, we place our chess knight on any numbered key of a phone pad (indicated above), and the knight makes N-1 hops.  Each hop must be from one key to another numbered key.

Each time it lands on a key (including the initial placement of the knight), it presses the number of that key, pressing N digits total.

How many distinct numbers can you dial in this manner?

Since the answer may be large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: 1
Output: 10
Example 2:

Input: 2
Output: 20
Example 3:

Input: 3
Output: 46
 

Note:

1 <= N <= 5000
```

## 5/5/2020 DP, multiple pass

```java
class Solution {
    public int knightDialer(int N) {
        int MOD = 1000000007;
        //use an array to store possible landing number starting from each number
        int[][] dialer = new int[][]{{4,6}, {6,8}, {7,9}, {4,8}, {3,9,0}, {}, {1,7,0}, {2,6}, {1,3}, {2,4}};
        //use dp array to store unique numbers formed for current step
        int[] dp = new int[10];
        Arrays.fill(dp, 1);
        //for every step
        for (int k = 1; k < N; ++k){
            //a dp to store results for the next step
            int[] dp2 = new int[10];
            //for every landing number
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i){
                for (var num : dialer[i]){
                    dp2[num] = (dp2[num] + dp[i]) % MOD;
                }
            }
            //update result
            dp = dp2;
        }
        //add up number of numbers ending at each number
        int total = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i){
            total = (total + dp[i]) % MOD;
        }
        return total;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Dp multiple pass\
Time complexity: O(N)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Use DP to store unique numbers formed for current step. Then we compute the DP array for every step. At the end, we have to sum up number of numbers ending at each number
