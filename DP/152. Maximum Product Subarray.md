https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/

## Keyword
DP, multiple status

## Problem description
```
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.

Example 1:

Input: [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
Example 2:

Input: [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProduct(int[] nums) {
        //use the first number as the current product
        int ans = nums[0];
        //iterate through all numbers, use min and max to store the max and min product starting from somewhere before the current number up to the current number
        for (int i = 1, min = ans, max = ans; i < nums.length; ++i) {
            int curr = nums[i];
            
            //compute current max, min using previous max, min
            if (curr < 0) { //if the current number is negative
                int maxTemp = max;
                //the max product could be itslef or the previous min product times itself
                max = Math.max(curr, min * curr);
                //the max product could be itslef or the previous max product times itself
                min = Math.min(curr, maxTemp * curr);
            } else { //for a positive number (case 0 is already included since no mater what the current max and min will be 0)
                //the max product could be itself or the previous max product times itself
                max = Math.max(curr, max * curr);
                //the min product could be itself or the previous min product times itself
                min = Math.min(curr, min * curr);
            }
            
            //update the ans
            ans = Math.max(ans, max);
        }

Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Use dp variables to store the max and min product starting from somewhere before the current number up to the current number. And current dp status depends on the previous dp status. Note that when the current number is negative, potentially the previous min times current number might yield the new max product and the previous max times current number might yield the new min product.
