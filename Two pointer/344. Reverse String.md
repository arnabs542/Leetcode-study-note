## Keyword
Array, Two pointer

## Problem description
```
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
Example 2:

Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

```java
class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        int left = 0, right = s.length - 1;
        char tmp;
        while(left < right){
            tmp = s[right];
            s[right] = s[left];
            s[left] = tmp;
            --right;
            ++left;
        }
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Nested loops\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Use two pointers to reverse array contents
