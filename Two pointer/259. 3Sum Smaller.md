## Keyword
Two pointer

## Problem description
```
Given an array of n integers nums and a target, find the number of index triplets i, j, k with 0 <= i < j < k < n that satisfy the condition nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target.

Example:

Input: nums = [-2,0,1,3], and target = 2
Output: 2 
Explanation: Because there are two triplets which sums are less than 2:
             [-2,0,1]
             [-2,0,3]
Follow up: Could you solve it in O(n2) runtime?

```java
class Solution {
    public int threeSumSmaller(int[] nums, int target) {
        int count = 0;
        //sort the array
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        //tree pointers
        for (int p1 = 0; p1 < nums.length; ++p1) {
            int targetSum = target - nums[p1];
            //find the number of two sums that's smaller than target
            for (int p2 = p1 + 1, p3 = nums.length - 1; p2 < p3;) {
                if (nums[p2] + nums[p3] < targetSum) {
                    count += p3 - p2;
                    ++p2;
                } else {
                    --p3;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

Time complexity: O(n^2)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
We sort the array first. The first pointer p1 goes through the array, p2 and p3 are both on its right side so there's no duplicates. Now the problem comes down to find the number of two sums that's smaller than target.  
p2 start on the left and p3 on the right. We decrease p3 until the sum is less than target. Then any p that's p > p2 && p <= p3 is a result pair. Then we increase p2 and do the same thing over until p2 meet p3. Note we have to use p2 as the base and consider the position btween the two pointers in this case so all corner cases will be taken care of. If the question asks for two sum larger than target, then we can use p3 as the base.
