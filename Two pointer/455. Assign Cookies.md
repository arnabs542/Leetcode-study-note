## LeetCode link(Easy)
https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/

## Keyword
Greedy, Two pointer

## Problem description
```
Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed factor gi, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size sj. If sj >= gi, we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

Note:
You may assume the greed factor is always positive.
You cannot assign more than one cookie to one child.

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3], [1,1]

Output: 1

Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.
Example 2:
Input: [1,2], [1,2,3]

Output: 2

Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
You need to output 2.

```java
class Solution {
    public int findContentChildren(int[] g, int[] s) {
        int ans = 0;
        //when there's no cookies or no children
        if(g.length == 0 || s.length == 0) return 0;
        //sort children && cookies
        Arrays.sort(g);
        Arrays.sort(s);
        //two pointers
        int p1 = 0, p2 = 0;
        //find cookies satisfy children
        while(p1 < g.length && p2 < s.length){
            //when the current cookie can satisfy the current child
            if(g[p1] <= s[p2]){
                ans++;
                p1++;
                p2++;
            }
            //when the current cookie cannot satisfy the current child, we need move on to the next cookie
            else{
                p2++;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

## Complexity Analyze
Two pointer\
Time complexity: O(nlogn + mlogm)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Sort both inputs, then use greedy algorithm and two pointers to find how many children can be satisfied.
