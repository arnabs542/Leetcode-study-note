https://leetcode.com/problems/palindromic-substrings/

## Keyword
Two pointer, String

## Problem description
```
Given a string, your task is to count how many palindromic substrings in this string.

The substrings with different start indexes or end indexes are counted as different substrings even they consist of same characters.

Example 1:

Input: "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".
 

Example 2:

Input: "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
 

Note:

The input string length won't exceed 1000.

```java
class Solution {
    public int countSubstrings(String s) {
        int count = 0;
        //use each character as center to expand
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i) {
            count += countAndExpand(s, i, i);
        }
        //use empty space between each character as center to expand
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length() - 1; ++i) {
            count += countAndExpand(s, i, i + 1);
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    private int countAndExpand(String s, int left, int right) {
        int count = 0;
        while (left >= 0 && right < s.length()) {
            if (s.charAt(left) == s.charAt(right)) {
                ++count;
                --left;
                ++right;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n^2)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Try to expand from any character, or the space between any two characters.
