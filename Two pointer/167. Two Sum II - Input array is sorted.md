## Keyword
Two pointer

## Problem description
```
Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

Note:

Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.
Example:

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.

## 4/8/2020 Two pointer

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] numbers, int target) {
        //two pointer
        int p1 = 0, p2 = numbers.length - 1;
        //interate through the input to find the answer
        while(p1 < p2){
            int n1 = numbers[p1], n2 = numbers[p2];
            if(n1 + n2 == target) return new int[]{p1 + 1, p2 + 1};
            if(n1 + n2 < target) p1++;
            else p2--;
        }
        return new int[]{-1, -1};
    }
}
```
## Complexity Analyze
Two pointer\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Use two pointers to interate people from both sides to find the right pair of numbers.
