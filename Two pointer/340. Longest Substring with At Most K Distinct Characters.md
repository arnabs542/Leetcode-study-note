https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-most-k-distinct-characters/

## Keyword
Two pointer + HashMap

## Problem description
```
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most k distinct characters.

Example 1:

Input: s = "eceba", k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: T is "ece" which its length is 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "aa", k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: T is "aa" which its length is 2.

        int ans = 0;
        //if the original string is empty
        if (s.length() == 0 || k == 0){
            return 0;
        }
        //use hashtable to store character counts in the window
        Map<Character, Integer> window = new HashMap<>();
        int distinct = 0;
        //two pointers to form sliding window [left, right]
        int left = 0, right = 0;
        //use the window to traverse through the string
        for (; right < s.length(); ++right){
            //add the character into the window
            char c = s.charAt(right);
            window.put(c, window.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
            if (window.get(c) == 1){
                ++distinct;
            }
            //there are no more than k distinct characters in the window
            if (distinct <= k){
                ans = Math.max(ans, right - left + 1);
            }
            //shrink the window until there are no more than k distinct characters
            else {
                while (distinct > k){
                    c = s.charAt(left);
                    window.put(c, window.get(c) - 1);
                    if (window.get(c) == 0){
                        --distinct;
                    }
                    ++left;
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Two pointer\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(n) -> O(k)

## Notes
We keep a sliding window and its content of at most k unique elements. Every time the number of unique elements exceed k, we will move the left bound to shrink it.

## Key points
Corner cases: when the string or k is empty\

                    window.remove(leftMost.getKey());
                    //shrink the window
                    left = leftMost.getValue() + 1;
                }
            }
            ans = Math.max(ans, right - left + 1);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Two pointer\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(k)

## Notes
In this solution, we use linked hash map to keep track of the latest index of each unique characters. This way when we need to remove a character, we can easily access the oldest unique character(the first in the linked list) and move the left bound of the window to exclude it.
