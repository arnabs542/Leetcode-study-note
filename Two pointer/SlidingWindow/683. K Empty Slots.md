## Problem description
```
You have N bulbs in a row numbered from 1 to N. Initially, all the bulbs are turned off. We turn on exactly one bulb everyday until all bulbs are on after N days.

You are given an array bulbs of length N where bulbs[i] = x means that on the (i+1)th day, we will turn on the bulb at position x where i is 0-indexed and x is 1-indexed.

Given an integer K, find out the minimum day number such that there exists two turned on bulbs that have exactly K bulbs between them that are all turned off.

If there isn't such day, return -1.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
bulbs: [1,3,2]
K: 1
Output: 2
Explanation:
On the first day: bulbs[0] = 1, first bulb is turned on: [1,0,0]
On the second day: bulbs[1] = 3, third bulb is turned on: [1,0,1]
On the third day: bulbs[2] = 2, second bulb is turned on: [1,1,1]
We return 2 because on the second day, there were two on bulbs with one off bulb between them.
Example 2:

Input: 
bulbs: [1,2,3]
K: 1
Output: -1
 

Note:

1 <= N <= 20000
1 <= bulbs[i] <= N
bulbs is a permutation of numbers from 1 to N.
0 <= K <= 20000

## 7/22/2020 TreeSet

```Java
class Solution {
    public int kEmptySlots(int[] bulbs, int K) {
        TreeSet<Integer> tree = new TreeSet<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < bulbs.length; ++i) {
            int b = bulbs[i];
            tree.add(b);
            if (tree.higher(b) != null && tree.higher(b) - b == K + 1) {
                return i + 1;
            }
            if (tree.lower(b) != null && b - tree.lower(b) == K + 1) {
                return i + 1;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}

## 7/22/2020 Sliding Window

```Java
class Solution {
    public int kEmptySlots(int[] bulbs, int K) {
        //build an array to show each light bulb's turn on day
        int[] days = new int[bulbs.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < bulbs.length; ++i) {
            days[bulbs[i] - 1] = i + 1;
        }
        //use sliding window to find the subarray of length k + 2 where sub[left] < sub[i] && sub[right] < sub[i]
        int left = 0;
        int right = K + 1;
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 1; right < days.length; ++i) {
            if (i == right) { //subarray found
                min = Math.min(min, Math.max(days[left], days[right]));
                left = right;
                right = left + K + 1;
            } else if (days[i] <= days[left] || days[i] <= days[right]) {
                left = i;
                right = i + K + 1;
            }
        }
        return min == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : min;
    }
}
