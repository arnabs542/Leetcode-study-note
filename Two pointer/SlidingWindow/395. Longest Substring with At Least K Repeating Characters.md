## Keyword
Sliding Window, HashMap

## Problem description
```
Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring of s such that the frequency of each character in this substring is greater than or equal to k.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "aaabb", k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
Example 2:

Input: s = "ababbc", k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of only lowercase English letters.
1 <= k <= 105
```
## 11/26/2020 Sliding window
```java
class Solution {
    public int longestSubstring(String s, int k) {
        
        int max = 0;
        int n = s.length();
        
        //i is the number of unique characters in the sliding window
        for (int i = 1; i <= 26; ++i) {
            //sliding window
            Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
            int validChar = 0;
            for (int r = 0, l = 0; r < n; ++r) {
                char newChar = s.charAt(r);
                map.put(newChar, map.getOrDefault(newChar, 0) + 1);
                if (map.get(newChar) == k) {
                    ++validChar;
                }
                //too many unique characters
                while (map.size() > i) {
                    char oldChar = s.charAt(l);
                    if (map.get(oldChar) == k) {
                        --validChar;
                    }
                    if (map.get(oldChar) == 1) {
                        map.remove(oldChar);
                    } else {
                        map.put(oldChar, map.get(oldChar) - 1);
                    }
                    ++l;
                }
                
                //see if the current window is valid
                if (validChar == i) {
                    max = Math.max(max, r - l + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return max;
    }
}
```

## Notes
Whatever position the window(substring) is at, the number of unique characters in the window can only be in range [1, 26]. If we set the number of unique characters in the window as i, then we can use a standard sliding window method to find all the maximum window that has i unique characters, and we can validate if such a window's characters all have at least k repeats and potentially update the max length. The reason why this works is because when we fix the number of unique characters in the window, expanding the current window will only be benefit for itself(getting more of the same characters that are already in the window and they might satisfy the k frequency rule).
