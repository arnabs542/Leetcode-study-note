## Keyword
Two pointer

## Problem description
```
Given two lists of closed intervals, each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.

Return the intersection of these two interval lists.

(Formally, a closed interval [a, b] (with a <= b) denotes the set of real numbers x with a <= x <= b.  The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that is either empty, or can be represented as a closed interval.  For example, the intersection of [1, 3] and [2, 4] is [2, 3].)

 

Example 1:



Input: A = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], B = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]
Output: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]
Reminder: The inputs and the desired output are lists of Interval objects, and not arrays or lists.
 

Note:

0 <= A.length < 1000
0 <= B.length < 1000
0 <= A[i].start, A[i].end, B[i].start, B[i].end < 10^9

## 4/8/2020 Two pointer

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] intervalIntersection(int[][] A, int[][] B) {
        List<int[]> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        //when either input is empty
        if(A.length == 0 || B.length == 0) return new int[][]{};
        //two pointers
        int p1 = 0, p2 = 0;
        //iterate through both arrays
        while(p1 < A.length && p2 < B.length){
            //check intersection
            int left = Math.max(A[p1][0], B[p2][0]);
            int right = Math.min(A[p1][1], B[p2][1]);
            if(left <= right) ans.add(new int[]{left, right});
            //update pointers
            if(A[p1][1] < B[p2][1]) p1++;
            else if(A[p1][1] > B[p2][1]) p2++;
            else{
                p1++;
                p2++;
            }
        }
        return ans.toArray(new int[ans.size()][]);
    }
}

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(m + n)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Use two pointers to interate through both input arrays while checking for intersections.

## Key points
Corner cases: \
API: ArrayList.toArray()
