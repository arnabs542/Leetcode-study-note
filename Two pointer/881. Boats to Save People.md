## Keyword
Two pointer

## Problem description
```
The i-th person has weight people[i], and each boat can carry a maximum weight of limit.

Each boat carries at most 2 people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most limit.

Return the minimum number of boats to carry every given person.  (It is guaranteed each person can be carried by a boat.)

 

Example 1:

Input: people = [1,2], limit = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 boat (1, 2)
Example 2:

Input: people = [3,2,2,1], limit = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 boats (1, 2), (2) and (3)
Example 3:

Input: people = [3,5,3,4], limit = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: 4 boats (3), (3), (4), (5)
Note:

1 <= people.length <= 50000
1 <= people[i] <= limit <= 30000
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int numRescueBoats(int[] people, int limit) {
        int ans = 0;
        //sort input array
        Arrays.sort(people);
        //iterate through people to compute boats needed, try to fit people in light + heavy pair
        int p1 = 0, p2 = people.length - 1;
        while(p1 <= p2){
            if(people[p1] + people[p2] <= limit){
                p1++;
                p2--;
                ans++;
            }
            //load heavy person first
            else{
                p2--;
                ans++;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
## Complexity Analyze
Two pointer\
Time complexity: O(nlogn)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Use two pointers to interate people from both sides so we can always try to load them in (light, heavy) pair to save boats.

## Key points
Corner cases: \
API: Arrays.sort()
