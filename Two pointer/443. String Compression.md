## Keyword
Two pointer

## Problem description
```
Given an array of characters, compress it in-place.

The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.

Every element of the array should be a character (not int) of length 1.

After you are done modifying the input array in-place, return the new length of the array.

 
Follow up:
Could you solve it using only O(1) extra space?

 
Example 1:

Input:
["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]

Output:
Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]

Explanation:
"aa" is replaced by "a2". "bb" is replaced by "b2". "ccc" is replaced by "c3".
 

Example 2:

Input:
["a"]

Output:
Return 1, and the first 1 characters of the input array should be: ["a"]

Explanation:
Nothing is replaced.
 

Example 3:

Input:
["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]

Output:
Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].

Explanation:
Since the character "a" does not repeat, it is not compressed. "bbbbbbbbbbbb" is replaced by "b12".
Notice each digit has it's own entry in the array.
 

Note:

All characters have an ASCII value in [35, 126].
1 <= len(chars) <= 1000.

```java
class Solution {
    public int compress(char[] chars) {
        //iterate through the input and compress it in-place
        char last = chars[0];
        int count = 0;
        int write = 0;
        for (int read = 0; read <= chars.length; ++read) {
            if (read < chars.length && chars[read] == last) { //same char
                ++count;
            } else { //different char
                //print the character
                chars[write] = last;
                ++write;
                if (count > 1) { //if more than 1 character
                    for(char c : Integer.toString(count).toCharArray()) {
                        chars[write] = c;
                        ++write;
                    }
                }
                //update character and count
                if (read < chars.length) {
                    last = chars[read];
                }
                count = 1;
            }
        }
        return write;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Use 1 pointer to scan the input and the other to write the result.

## Key points
Corner cases: When the iterator is out of bound\
API: String.toCharArray()
