## Keyword
Two pointer

## Problem description
```
Given an array of integers A sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number, also in sorted non-decreasing order.

 

Example 1:

Input: [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Example 2:

Input: [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
 

Note:

1 <= A.length <= 10000
-10000 <= A[i] <= 10000
A is sorted in non-decreasing order.

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] sortedSquares(int[] A) {
        int[] ans = new int[A.length];
        int p = A.length - 1;
        //two pointers
        int p1 = 0, p2 = A.length - 1;
        //iterate through the array to compute squares
        while(p1 <= p2){
            int s1 = A[p1] * A[p1], s2 = A[p2] * A[p2];
            if(s1 > s2){
                ans[p--] = s1;
                p1++;
            }
            else if(s1 < s2){
                ans[p--] = s2;
                p2--;
            }
            else{
                ans[p--] = s1;
                p1++;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

## Complexity Analyze
Two pointer\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
We can start adding squares from both side since the biggest square has to be on one end. Note we can use int[] directly for answer since we know the length of it.

## Key points
Corner cases: \
API: Arrays.sort()
