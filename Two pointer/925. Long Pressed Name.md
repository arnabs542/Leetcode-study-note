## Keyword
Two pointer

## Problem description
```
Your friend is typing his name into a keyboard.  Sometimes, when typing a character c, the key might get long pressed, and the character will be typed 1 or more times.

You examine the typed characters of the keyboard.  Return True if it is possible that it was your friends name, with some characters (possibly none) being long pressed.

 

Example 1:

Input: name = "alex", typed = "aaleex"
Output: true
Explanation: 'a' and 'e' in 'alex' were long pressed.
Example 2:

Input: name = "saeed", typed = "ssaaedd"
Output: false
Explanation: 'e' must have been pressed twice, but it wasn't in the typed output.
Example 3:

Input: name = "leelee", typed = "lleeelee"
Output: true
Example 4:

Input: name = "laiden", typed = "laiden"
Output: true
Explanation: It's not necessary to long press any character.
 

Note:

name.length <= 1000
typed.length <= 1000
The characters of name and typed are lowercase letters.
```

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isLongPressedName(String name, String typed) {
        //when inputs are empty
        if(name.length() == 0 && typed.length() == 0) return true;
        if(name.length() == 0 || typed.length() == 0) return false;
        //two pointers
        int l = 0, r = 0;
        char prev = '$';
        while(l < name.length() && r < typed.length()){
            //skip when typed is the same as name
            if(name.charAt(l) == typed.charAt(r)){
                prev = typed.charAt(r);
                l++;
                r++;
            }
            //when typed and name are not same, check if typed has repeat
            else{
                if(typed.charAt(r) == prev) r++;
                else return false;
            }
        }
        //if more name character is left to be checked, typed is wrong
        if(l < name.length()) return false;
        //if more typed character is left to be checked, check if they are the same
        while(r < typed.length()){
            if(prev != typed.charAt(r)) return false;
            r++;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
## Complexity Analyze
Two pointer\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Use two pointers to check if typed is valid. Note that when the two pointers exit the while loop, we have to do post-processing on the remaining characters in both strings.
