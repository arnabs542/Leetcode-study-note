## Problem description
```
In an alien language, surprisingly they also use english lowercase letters, but possibly in a different order. The order of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.

Given a sequence of words written in the alien language, and the order of the alphabet, return true if and only if the given words are sorted lexicographicaly in this alien language.

 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: true
Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.
Example 2:

Input: words = ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, then words[0] > words[1], hence the sequence is unsorted.
Example 3:

Input: words = ["apple","app"], order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: The first three characters "app" match, and the second string is shorter (in size.) According to lexicographical rules "apple" > "app", because 'l' > '∅', where '∅' is defined as the blank character which is less than any other character (More info).
 

Constraints:

1 <= words.length <= 100
1 <= words[i].length <= 20
order.length == 26
All characters in words[i] and order are English lowercase letters.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isAlienSorted(String[] words, String order) { 
        //array store the order
        int[] map = new int[26];
        for (int i = 0; i <order.length(); ++i) {
            map[order.charAt(i) - 'a'] = i;
        }
        //check whether the words could generate a possible dictionary
        for (int i = 1; i < words.length; ++i){
            String last = words[i - 1];
            String cur = words[i];
            //flag if existing characters are all the same
            boolean isSame = true;
            for (int j = 0; j < Math.min(last.length(), cur.length()); ++j){
                if (last.charAt(j) != cur.charAt(j)) {
                    isSame = false;
                    //check if the order is sorted by the alien dictionary
                    if (map[last.charAt(j) - 'a'] > map[cur.charAt(j) - 'a']) {
                        return false;
                    }
                    break;
                }
            }
            //if existing characters are all the same, then the last string cannot be longer
            if (isSame && last.length() > cur.length()) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}

## Complexity Analyze
compare 1 by 1\
Time complexity: O(C) C is the total number of characters in the dict\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Compare every two words to see they have the valid order.
