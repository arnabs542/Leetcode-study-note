## LeetCode link(Medium)
https://leetcode.com/problems/leftmost-column-with-at-least-a-one/

## Keyword
Binary search, matrix iteration

## Problem description
```
(This problem is an interactive problem.)

A binary matrix means that all elements are 0 or 1. For each individual row of the matrix, this row is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Given a row-sorted binary matrix binaryMatrix, return leftmost column index(0-indexed) with at least a 1 in it. If such index doesn't exist, return -1.

You can't access the Binary Matrix directly.  You may only access the matrix using a BinaryMatrix interface:

BinaryMatrix.get(row, col) returns the element of the matrix at index (row, col) (0-indexed).
BinaryMatrix.dimensions() returns a list of 2 elements [rows, cols], which means the matrix is rows * cols.
Submissions making more than 1000 calls to BinaryMatrix.get will be judged Wrong Answer.  Also, any solutions that attempt to circumvent the judge will result in disqualification.

For custom testing purposes you're given the binary matrix mat as input in the following four examples. You will not have access the binary matrix directly.

 

 

 

Example 1:



Input: mat = [[0,0],[1,1]]
Output: 0
Example 2:



Input: mat = [[0,0],[0,1]]
Output: 1
Example 3:



Input: mat = [[0,0],[0,0]]
Output: -1
Example 4:



Input: mat = [[0,0,0,1],[0,0,1,1],[0,1,1,1]]
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

rows == mat.length
cols == mat[i].length
1 <= rows, cols <= 100
mat[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
mat[i] is sorted in a non-decreasing way.

```java
/**
 * // This is the BinaryMatrix's API interface.
 * // You should not implement it, or speculate about its implementation
 * interface BinaryMatrix {
 *     public int get(int x, int y) {}
 *     public List<Integer> dimensions {}

class Solution {
    public int leftMostColumnWithOne(BinaryMatrix binaryMatrix) {
        //get matrix dimensions
        List<Integer> dimension = binaryMatrix.dimensions();
        int n = dimension.get(0), m = dimension.get(1);
        int leftmost = 100;
        //do binary search at the each row to find the leftmost index that has 1
        int l = 0, r = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            l = 0;
            r = m - 1;
            while(l < r){
                int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
                if(binaryMatrix.get(i, mid) == 1){
                    r = mid;
                }
                else{
                    l = mid + 1;
                }
            }
            leftmost = Math.min(leftmost, binaryMatrix.get(i, l) == 1 ? l : 100);
        }
        return leftmost == 100 ? -1 : leftmost;
    }
}

binary search\
Time complexity: O(log(m) * n)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
We can use binary search row by row to find the left most 1.

```java
class Solution {
  public int leftMostColumnWithOne(BinaryMatrix binaryMatrix) {
    
    int rows = binaryMatrix.dimensions().get(0);
    int cols = binaryMatrix.dimensions().get(1);

    // Set pointers to the top-right corner.
    int currentRow = 0;
    int currentCol = cols - 1;
    
    // Repeat the search until it goes off the grid.
    while (currentRow < rows && currentCol >= 0) {
      if (binaryMatrix.get(currentRow, currentCol) == 0) {
        currentRow++;
      } else {
        currentCol--; 
      }
    }
    
    // If we never left the last column, this is because it was all 0's.
    return (currentCol == cols - 1) ? -1 : currentCol + 1;
  }
}
```

## Notes
This is a greedy way to interate through the matrix.
