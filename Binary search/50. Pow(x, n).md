Share
Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (xn).

Example 1:

Input: 2.00000, 10
Output: 1024.00000
Example 2:

Input: 2.10000, 3
Output: 9.26100
Example 3:

Input: 2.00000, -2
Output: 0.25000
Explanation: 2-2 = 1/22 = 1/4 = 0.25
Note:

-100.0 < x < 100.0
n is a 32-bit signed integer, within the range [−2^31, 2^31 − 1]

```java
class Solution {
    public double myPow(double x, int n) {
        //increase integer to long to avoid overflow problem
        long N = n;
        if(N < 0){
            x = 1 / x;
            N = -N;
        } 
        double ans = 1;
        double curProduct = x;
        //keep increasing the curProduct exponentially until i reaches 0
        for(long i = N; i > 0; i /= 2){
            //when i is odd, reduce i by 1 so it's even
            if(i % 2 == 1){
                ans *= curProduct;
            }
            curProduct *= curProduct;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(logn)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
We increase the product exponentially to reduce n in an algorithmic manner. This way it will reduce time complexity to logn since we only have to loop logn times. Note that we need to cast orginal int to long to avoid the overflow problem

## 2/25/2020 Binary search recursion

```java
class Solution {
    public double myPow(double x, int n) {
        //increase integer to long to avoid overflow problem
        long N = n;
        if(N < 0){
            x = 1 / x;
            N = -N;
        } 
        //keep increasing the curProduct exponentially until N reaches 0
        return helper(x, N);
    }
    private double helper(double curProduct, long n){
        //return 1 if power is 0
        if(n == 0) return 1;
        //power(curProduct, n) is power(curProduct ^ 2, n / 2)
        if(n % 2 == 1){
            return curProduct * helper(curProduct * curProduct, n / 2);
        }
        else{
            return helper(curProduct * curProduct, n / 2);
        }
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(logn)\
Space complexity: O(logn)

## Notes
We can use recursion to change power(curProduct, n) to power(curProduct ^ 2, n / 2) until n is 0
