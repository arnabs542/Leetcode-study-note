## Keyword
Array Binary search

## Problem description
```
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```
## 1/26/2020 Solution using binary search

```java
class Solution {
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        //initial start an end position for this search
        int start = 0, end = nums.length - 1;
        while(start <= end){
            int mid = (start + end) / 2;
            //index found
            if(nums[mid] == target){
                return mid;
            }
            //the pivot is not in the left half
            else if(nums[mid] >= nums[start]){
                if(target >= nums[start] && target < nums[mid]){
                    end = mid - 1;
                }
                else{
                    start = mid + 1;
                }
            }
            //the pivot is in the left half
            else{
                if(nums[mid] < target && target <= nums[end]){
                    start = mid + 1;
                }
                else{
                    end = mid - 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
One pass binary search\
Time complexity: O(logn)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
We can use binary search in one pass if we apply different codition in the search.\
When determining if the pivot point is in left half, the condition should be nums[mid] >= nums[start] instead of ">"
