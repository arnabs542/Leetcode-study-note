## Keyword
Array Binary search

## Problem description
```
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```
## 1/26/2020 Solution using binary search

```java
class Solution {
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        int n = nums.length;
        //binary search
        int l = 0, r = n - 1;
        while(l < r){
            int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
            //if the current left half is sorted
            if(nums[m] >= nums[l]){
                if(target >= nums[l] && target <= nums[m]){
                    r = m;
                }
                else{
                    l = m + 1;
                }
            }
            //if the current left half is not sorted
            else{
                if(target <= nums[r] && nums[m] < target){
                    l = m + 1;
                }
                else{
                    r = m;
                }
            }
        }
        //post processing
        if(l > n - 1 || nums[l] != target) return -1;
        else return l;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(logn)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
We can use binary search in one pass if we apply different codition in the search. Note we need to determine if the current index is in the sorted half, and if the target index is in the sorted half
