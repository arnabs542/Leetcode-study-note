https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/

## Keyword
Binary search

## Problem description
```
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Example 1:

Input: [3,4,5,1,2] 
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
        //binary search
        int l = 0, r = nums.length - 1;
        while(l < r){
            int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
            if(nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]) return nums[mid + 1];
            //check if the point is on the left of the pivot point
            if(nums[mid] >= nums[0]){
                l = mid + 1;
            }
            else{
                r = mid;
            }
        }
        //if the search cannot find the right pivot point, it's either there's only 1 element in the array or the array is not rotated
        return nums[0];
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
binary search\
Time complexity: O(logn)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Simple binary search, be careful with the corner cases. Also not that even there's no duplicates in the array, the comparison should still be nums[mid] >= nums[0] because the pivot point might be the first element

## Key points
Corner cases: When there's only 1 element or when the pivot point doesn't exist.\
