## Keyword
Binary search, Math

## Problem description
```
You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.

Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.

n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

Example 1:

n = 5

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
Example 2:

n = 8

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.

## Notes
If we look deeper into the formula of the problem, we could actually solve it with the help of mathematics, without using any iteration.

As a reminder, the constraint of the problem can be expressed as follows:

$$
k(k + 1) \le 2N
$$

This could be solved by completing the square technique,
$$
\left(k + \frac{1}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{4} \le 2N
 $$

that results in the following answer:
$$
k = \left[\sqrt{2N + \frac{1}{4}} - \frac{1}{2}\right]
 $$
