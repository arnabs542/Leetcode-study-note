## Keyword
Binary search, Greedy

## Problem description
```
You have one chocolate bar that consists of some chunks. Each chunk has its own sweetness given by the array sweetness.

You want to share the chocolate with your K friends so you start cutting the chocolate bar into K+1 pieces using K cuts, each piece consists of some consecutive chunks.

Being generous, you will eat the piece with the minimum total sweetness and give the other pieces to your friends.

Find the maximum total sweetness of the piece you can get by cutting the chocolate bar optimally.

 

Example 1:

Input: sweetness = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], K = 5
Output: 6
Explanation: You can divide the chocolate to [1,2,3], [4,5], [6], [7], [8], [9]
Example 2:

Input: sweetness = [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], K = 8
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one way to cut the bar into 9 pieces.
Example 3:

Input: sweetness = [1,2,2,1,2,2,1,2,2], K = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: You can divide the chocolate to [1,2,2], [1,2,2], [1,2,2]
 

Constraints:

0 <= K < sweetness.length <= 10^4
1 <= sweetness[i] <= 10^5

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximizeSweetness(int[] sweetness, int K) {
        //use binary search to find the max sweetness I can get
        int l = 1;
        int r = 1000000001;
        while (l < r) {
            int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
            if (!canDivide(sweetness, K, m)) {
                r = m;
            } else {
                l = m + 1;
            }
        }
        return l - 1;
    }
    private boolean canDivide(int[] sweetness, int K, int min) {
        //greedily divide chunks of sweetness equal or barely larger than the min to other kids
        int cur = 0;
        for (int s : sweetness) {
            cur += s;
            if (cur >= min) {
                cur = 0;
                --K;
            }
        }
        return K <= -1;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(log(S * N) * N) where N is number of chocolate chunks and S is maximum sweetness\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Use binary search to find the max sweetness I can get. For each guessed sweetness, we can traverse the sweetness array greedily to see if we can divide these chocolates can be divided to K + 1 parts.
