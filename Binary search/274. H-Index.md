## Keyword
Binary search, counting sort

## Problem description
```
Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

## 7/26/2020 Binary search

```java
class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        //sort the citations
        Arrays.sort(citations);
        int n = citations.length;
        //use binary search to find the h index
        int l = 0;
        int r = n;
        while (l < r) {
            int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
            if (citations[m] >= (n - m)) {
                r = m;
            } else {
                l = m + 1;
            }
        }
        return n - l;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(nlog(n))\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Use binary search to find the first index that satisfies citations[index] >= n - index. Note such index might not exists so the starting right bound needs to be n.

## 7/26/2020 Community counting sort

```java
public class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        int n = citations.length;
        int[] papers = new int[n + 1];
        // counting papers for each citation number
        for (int c: citations)
            papers[Math.min(n, c)]++;
        // finding the h-index
        int k = n;
        for (int s = papers[n]; k > s; s += papers[k])
            k--;
        return k;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Since any paper with citation number larger than total paper number n doesn't effect anything with their extra height, we can decrease those citations to be n. Then we can use array size of n + 1 to do a counting sort(hash table).
