## LeetCode link(Hard)
https://leetcode.com/problems/k-th-smallest-prime-fraction/

## Keyword
Binary search, Two pointers, sliding window

## Problem description
```
A sorted list A contains 1, plus some number of primes.  Then, for every p < q in the list, we consider the fraction p/q.

What is the K-th smallest fraction considered?  Return your answer as an array of ints, where answer[0] = p and answer[1] = q.

Examples:
Input: A = [1, 2, 3, 5], K = 3
Output: [2, 5]
Explanation:
The fractions to be considered in sorted order are:
1/5, 1/3, 2/5, 1/2, 3/5, 2/3.
The third fraction is 2/5.

Input: A = [1, 7], K = 1
Output: [1, 7]
Note:

A will have length between 2 and 2000.
Each A[i] will be between 1 and 30000.
K will be between 1 and A.length * (A.length - 1) / 2.
```
## 4/3/2020 Binary search + sliding window

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] kthSmallestPrimeFraction(int[] A, int K) {
        //we can use binary search to find the perfect number where K fractions are smaller than it
        double l = 0.0, r = 1.0;
        while(l < r){
            double m = l + (r - l) / 2;
            //count how many fractions are smaller than m
            int count = 0;
            int nomer = 0, denom = 1;
            for(int j = 1, i = -1; j < A.length; j++){
                while(A[i + 1] < m * A[j]) i++;
                count += i + 1;
                //update the biggest fraction that's smaller than m so far
                if(i >= 0 && A[i] * denom > A[j] * nomer){
                    nomer = A[i];
                    denom = A[j];
                }
            }
            //when the perfect m is found
            if(count == K) return new int[]{nomer, denom};
            if(count > K) r = m;
            else l = m;
        }
        return new int[]{-1, -1};
    }
}

## Complexity Analyze
binary search\
Time complexity: O(nlog(w). where w is the quantized units of search width\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
For any given number, we can use O(n) two pointer sliding window method to compute how many fractions are smaller than this given value while keeping the biggest fraction in storage for such a search. Thus we use a binary search to find such a number between 0 and 1. And the biggest fraction found during that search is the kth fraction number we are looking for.

## 4/3/2020 Priority Queue

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] kthSmallestPrimeFraction(int[] A, int K) {
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<int[]>((a, b) ->
                A[a[0]] * A[b[1]] - A[a[1]] * A[b[0]]);

        for (int i = 1; i < A.length; ++i)
            pq.add(new int[]{0, i});

        while (--K > 0) {
            int[] frac = pq.poll();
            if (frac[0]++ < frac[1])
                pq.offer(frac);
        }

        int[] ans = pq.poll();
        return new int[]{A[ans[0]], A[ans[1]]};
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
priority queue\
Time complexity: O(KlogN)\
Space complexity: O(N)

## Notes
We can use priority queue to always poll the smallest fraction while adding the next fraction with the same denominator in the priority queue. The Kth poll will be the answer. Note that we have to put smallest fraction with all different denominator in the priority queue to start with.
