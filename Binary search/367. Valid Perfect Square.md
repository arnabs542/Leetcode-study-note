## Keyword
Binary search

## Problem description
```
Given a positive integer num, write a function which returns True if num is a perfect square else False.

Note: Do not use any built-in library function such as sqrt.

Example 1:

Input: 16
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: 14
Output: false
```

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPerfectSquare(int num) {
        //use binary search to find the potential square root
        int l = 1;
        int r = num;
        while (l < r){
            int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
            if ((long)m * (long)m >= num){
                r = m;
            }
            else {
                l = m + 1;
            }
        }
        return l * l == num;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
logarithmic searches\
Time complexity: O(logn)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Note we have to use (long) type to prevent stack overflow

## Community Newton's Method Java

```java
class Solution {
  public boolean isPerfectSquare(int num) {
    if (num < 2) return true;

    long x = num / 2;
    while (x * x > num) {
      x = (x + num / x) / 2;
    }
    return (x * x == num);
  }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
logarithmic runs since the set converges quadratically\
Time complexity: O(logn)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Newton's method try to search for squre root by using guess = (guess + x / guess) / 2 one at a time. Apprently every iteration will decrease the guess number so once it's not greater than the exact answer then the guess is good. Notice that we need to use (long) for guess otherwise guess + 1 might be bigger than (Integer.MAX_VALUE)

## Key points
Corner cases: When x is less than 2, return itself\
