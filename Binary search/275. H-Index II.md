## Problem description
```
Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:

Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
Note:

If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

Follow up:

This is a follow up problem to H-Index, where citations is now guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?

```java
class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        int n = citations.length;
        //binary search to find the first index that citations[index] >= n - index
        int l = 0;
        int r = n;
        while (l < r) {
            int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
            if (n - m <= citations[m]) {
                r = m;
            } else {
                l = m + 1;
            }
        }
        return n - l;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(log(n))\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Use binary search to find the first index that satisfies citations[index] >= n - index. Note such index might not exists so the starting right bound needs to be n.
