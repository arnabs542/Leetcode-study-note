## Keyword
Binary search

## Problem description
```
Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You may assume no duplicates in the array.

Example 1:

Input: [1,3,5,6], 5
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: [1,3,5,6], 2
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: [1,3,5,6], 7
Output: 4
Example 4:

Input: [1,3,5,6], 0
Output: 0

```java
class Solution {
    public int searchInsert(int[] nums, int target) {
        //binary search
        int l = 0, r = nums.length;
        while (l < r){
            int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
            if (nums[m] >= target) r = m;
            else l = m + 1;
        }
        return l;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
binary search\
Time complexity: O(logn)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Typical binary search to find left most element that meets the condition in a range.
