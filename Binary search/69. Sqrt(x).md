## Keyword
Binary search

## Problem description
```
Implement int sqrt(int x).

Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

Example 1:

Input: 4
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.

```java
class Solution {
    public int mySqrt(int x) {
        //corner cases
        if(x == 0 || x == 1) return x;
        //binary search
        int l = 1, r = x;
        while(l < r){
            int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
            //prevent overflow by using long type
            long product = (long)m * (long)m;
            //implicitly casting
            if(product > x) r = m;
            else l = m + 1;
        }
        return l - 1;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
logarithmic searches\
Time complexity: O(logn)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Use binary search to find the biggest number that is smaller or equal to the square root of x

## Key points
Corner cases: When x is less than 2, return itself; Remember to use (long) for guess^2 since it might be bigger than (int)\

## Community Newton's Method Java

```java
class Solution {
  public int mySqrt(int x) {
    if (x < 2) return x;

    long guess = x;
    while (guess * guess > x) {
      guess = (guess + x / guess) / 2;
    }

    return (int)guess;
  }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
logarithmic runs since the set converges quadratically\
Time complexity: O(logn)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Newton's method try to search for squre root by using guess = (guess + x / guess) / 2 one at a time. Apprently every iteration will decrease the guess number so once it's not greater than the exact answer then the guess is good. Notice that we need to use (long) for guess otherwise guess + 1 might be bigger than (Integer.MAX_VALUE)

## Key points
Corner cases: When x is less than 2, return itself\
