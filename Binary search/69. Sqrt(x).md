Binary search

## Problem description
```
Implement int sqrt(int x).

Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

Example 1:

Input: 4
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.

    public int mySqrt(int x) {
        if(x < 2) return x;
        int pivot, left = 1, right = x / 2;
        long guess;
        while(left <= right){
            pivot = (left + right) / 2;
            guess = (long)pivot * (long)pivot;
            if(guess > x)
                right = pivot - 1;
            else if(guess <= x && (long)(pivot + 1) * (long)(pivot + 1) > x)
                return pivot;
            else
                left = pivot + 1;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
logarithmic searches\
Time complexity: O(logn)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Use binary search to search for in scope of 1 <= guess < x / 2 (when x > 2). Notice the answer has to be <= x and answer + 1 is > x

## Key points
Corner cases: When x is less than 2, return itself; Remember to use (long) for guess^2 since it might be bigger than (int)\

    long num;
    int pivot, left = 2, right = x / 2;
    while (left <= right) {
      pivot = left + (right - left) / 2;
      if (pivot > x / pivot) right = pivot - 1;

## Complexity Analyze
logarithmic searches\
Time complexity: O(logn)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
This version of binary search only tries to return when pivot is just next number less than when pivot > x / pivot. It will come back to what might be the right answer but is missed in the previous searches because it only ends when the search is complete(left > right). Notice that if we use pivot > x / pivot comparison we don't have to use (long) for pivot. Also, for any x > 2, the square root is guaranteed to be less than its half so we can start right boundery at x / 2

## Key points
Corner cases: When x is less than 2, return itself; We should start the right boundery at x / 2\

## Community Newton's Method Java

```java
class Solution {
  public int mySqrt(int x) {
    if (x < 2) return x;

    long guess = x;
    while (guess * guess > x) {
      guess = (guess + x / guess) / 2;
    }

    return (int)guess;
  }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
logarithmic runs since the set converges quadratically\
Time complexity: O(logn)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Newton's method try to search for squre root by using guess = (guess + x / guess) / 2 one at a time. Apprently every iteration will decrease the guess number so once it's not greater than the exact answer then the guess is good. Notice that we need to use (long) for guess otherwise guess + 1 might be bigger than (Integer.MAX_VALUE)

## Key points
Corner cases: When x is less than 2, return itself\
