## Problem description
```
Koko loves to eat bananas.  There are N piles of bananas, the i-th pile has piles[i] bananas.  The guards have gone and will come back in H hours.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of K.  Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas, and eats K bananas from that pile.  If the pile has less than K bananas, she eats all of them instead, and won't eat any more bananas during this hour.

Koko likes to eat slowly, but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards come back.

Return the minimum integer K such that she can eat all the bananas within H hours.

 

Example 1:

Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], H = 8
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], H = 5
Output: 30
Example 3:

Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], H = 6
Output: 23
 

Note:

1 <= piles.length <= 10^4
piles.length <= H <= 10^9
1 <= piles[i] <= 10^9

```java
class Solution {
    public int minEatingSpeed(int[] piles, int H) {
        long sum = 0;
        int max = 0;
        for(var i : piles) {
            sum += i;
            max = Math.max(max, i);
        }
        //the best case for KoKo to eat bananas is when there's only 1 basket of banana and number of bananas is multiples of H, this gives us the lower bound of the search
        int l = (int)sum / H;
        l = Math.max(l, 1);
        //the worst case for KoKo needs to eat all banans in the biggest basket in 1 hour, this gives us the upper bound of the search
        int r = max;
        //binary search
        while(l < r){
            int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
            int time = 0;
            for(var i : piles){
                //when i cannot be 0, we can use this equation to measure time
                time += (i - 1) / mid + 1;
            }
            if(time > H) l = mid + 1;
            else r = mid;
        }
        return l;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
binary search\
Time complexity: O(nlog(W)) where n is the number of piles and W is the max number of banana of 1 basket\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Simple binary search. Note that we don't need to reduce search area since the limit is listed.
