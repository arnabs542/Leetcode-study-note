## Problem description
```
You are given an array target that consists of distinct integers and another integer array arr that can have duplicates.

In one operation, you can insert any integer at any position in arr. For example, if arr = [1,4,1,2], you can add 3 in the middle and make it [1,4,3,1,2]. Note that you can insert the integer at the very beginning or end of the array.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make target a subsequence of arr.

A subsequence of an array is a new array generated from the original array by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the remaining elements' relative order. For example, [2,7,4] is a subsequence of [4,2,3,7,2,1,4] (the underlined elements), while [2,4,2] is not.

 

Example 1:

Input: target = [5,1,3], arr = [9,4,2,3,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: You can add 5 and 1 in such a way that makes arr = [5,9,4,1,2,3,4], then target will be a subsequence of arr.
Example 2:

Input: target = [6,4,8,1,3,2], arr = [4,7,6,2,3,8,6,1]
Output: 3
 

Constraints:

1 <= target.length, arr.length <= 105
1 <= target[i], arr[i] <= 109
target contains no duplicates.

```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] target, int[] arr) {
        //map numbers to their index
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int n = target.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            map.put(target[i], i);
        }
        
        //find the longest increasing subsequence in arr when all numbers are transformed to index
        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i : arr) {
            if (!map.containsKey(i)) {
                continue;
            }
            i = map.get(i);
            //use binary search to find the first number that's smaller than the new number in the current LIS
            int l = 0;
            int r = list.size();
            while (l < r) {
                int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
                if (list.get(m) >= i) {
                    r = m;
                } else {
                    l = m + 1;
                }
            }
            if (l == list.size()) {
                list.add(i);
            } else {
                list.set(l, i);
            }
        }
        return n - list.size();
    }
}

Time complexity: O(nlogn)  
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
At first glimpse, the problem seems to be a Longest Common Subsequence problem which needs O(n^2) to solve. But the key point here is that the target array has unique elements. So we can index of numbers in the target array in the other array and transfer the problem into a Longest Increasing Subsequence problem. And for a LIS problem, we can use a monotonic stack to store the LIS and use binary search to update the stack for every new element in the array.
