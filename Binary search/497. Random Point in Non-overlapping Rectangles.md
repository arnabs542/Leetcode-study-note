## Problem description
```
Given a list of non-overlapping axis-aligned rectangles rects, write a function pick which randomly and uniformily picks an integer point in the space covered by the rectangles.

Note:

An integer point is a point that has integer coordinates. 
A point on the perimeter of a rectangle is included in the space covered by the rectangles. 
ith rectangle = rects[i] = [x1,y1,x2,y2], where [x1, y1] are the integer coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and [x2, y2] are the integer coordinates of the top-right corner.
length and width of each rectangle does not exceed 2000.
1 <= rects.length <= 100
pick return a point as an array of integer coordinates [p_x, p_y]
pick is called at most 10000 times.
Example 1:

Input: 
["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
[[[[1,1,5,5]]],[],[],[]]
Output: 
[null,[4,1],[4,1],[3,3]]
Example 2:

Input: 
["Solution","pick","pick","pick","pick","pick"]
[[[[-2,-2,-1,-1],[1,0,3,0]]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output: 
[null,[-1,-2],[2,0],[-2,-1],[3,0],[-2,-2]]
Explanation of Input Syntax:

The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. Solution's constructor has one argument, the array of rectangles rects. pick has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.

```java
class Solution {

    int[][] rects;
    List<Integer> psum = new ArrayList<>();
    int tot = 0;
    Random rand = new Random();

    public Solution(int[][] rects) {
        this.rects = rects;
        for (int[] x : rects){
            //each rectangle has this many points
            tot += (x[2] - x[0] + 1) * (x[3] - x[1] + 1);
            psum.add(tot);
        }
    }

    public int[] pick() {
        int target = rand.nextInt(tot);
        
        //use binary search to find the rectangle that target number points to
        int lo = 0;
        int hi = rects.length - 1;
        while (lo < hi) {
            int mid = (lo + hi) / 2;
            //the smallest psum.get(mid) that's larger than target
            if (psum.get(mid) > target) {
                hi = mid;
            } else {
                lo = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        
        //find the point that target number points to
        int[] x = rects[lo];
        int width = x[2] - x[0] + 1;
        int height = x[3] - x[1] + 1;
        int base = psum.get(lo) - width * height;
        return new int[]{x[0] + (target - base) % width, x[1] + (target - base) / width};
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(logn)  
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Compute prefix sum of points, use random and binary search to find a random rectangle, then compute the point the target number points to.
