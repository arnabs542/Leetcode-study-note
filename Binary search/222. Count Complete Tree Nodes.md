## Keyword
Tree, DFS, Binary search

## Problem description
```
Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

Note:

Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

Example:

Input: 
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \  /
4  5 6

Output: 6

## 3/27/2020 DFS recursion

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int countNodes(TreeNode root) {
        return root != null ? 1 + countNodes(root.left) + countNodes(root.right) : 0;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
DFS\
Time complexity: O(n) \
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Naive dfs traversal. This solution does not profit from the fact that the tree is complete.

        --l;
        //substract missing nodes from a full tree node count

        total -= (last - l - 1);
        return total;
    }
    private boolean hasNode(TreeNode root, int last, int index) {
        //check if the index node is missing in the last row
        while (last != 1) {
            last /= 2;
            if (index < last) {
                root = root.left;
            } else {
                root = root.right;
                index -= last;
            }
        }
        return root != null;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Binary search\
Time complexity: O((logn) ^ 2) \
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
To find out how many nodes are in the bottom level, we can use a binary search. And each search takes O(logn) to travel from root to the bottom level of the tree. So in total the time complexity of this method is O((logn) ^ 2) which is a lot smaller than the regular O(n) search.

## Key points
Corner cases: when the tree is empty & when the tree only has 1 node(root)\
