## Keyword
Binary search

## Problem description
```
Nearly every one have used the Multiplication Table. But could you find out the k-th smallest number quickly from the multiplication table?

Given the height m and the length n of a m * n Multiplication Table, and a positive integer k, you need to return the k-th smallest number in this table.

Example 1:
Input: m = 3, n = 3, k = 5
Output: 
Explanation: 
The Multiplication Table:
1	2	3
2	4	6
3	6	9

The 5-th smallest number is 3 (1, 2, 2, 3, 3).
Example 2:
Input: m = 2, n = 3, k = 6
Output: 
Explanation: 
The Multiplication Table:
1	2	3
2	4	6

The 6-th smallest number is 6 (1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 6).
Note:
The m and n will be in the range [1, 30000].
The k will be in the range [1, m * n]

```java
class Solution {
    public int findKthNumber(int m, int n, int k) {
        //binary search to find kth smallest number
        int l = 1, r = m * n;
        while(l < r){
            int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
            //use mid number as the target to check how many elements are not bigger than it in the table
            if(noBigger(m, n, mid) < k) l = mid + 1;
            else r = mid;
        }
        return l;
    }
    //for a given target, find how many elements are not bigger than the target in the table
    private int noBigger(int m, int n, int target){
        //total elements
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i <= m; i++){
            //how many elements in each row is smaller than the target
            count += Math.min(target / i, n);
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
binary search\
Time complexity: O(log(m * n) * m)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Since this is a mutiplication table, we can easily calulate how many elements are smaller than a given target in the table. Then we do a binary search to find the kth element in the table using different target.
