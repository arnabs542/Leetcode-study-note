## Keyword
Array, Binary search, Two pointers

## Problem description
```
Given an integer array, return the k-th smallest distance among all the pairs. The distance of a pair (A, B) is defined as the absolute difference between A and B.

Example 1:
Input:
nums = [1,3,1]
k = 1
Output: 0 
Explanation:
Here are all the pairs:
(1,3) -> 2
(1,1) -> 0
(3,1) -> 2
Then the 1st smallest distance pair is (1,1), and its distance is 0.
Note:
2 <= len(nums) <= 10000.
0 <= nums[i] < 1000000.
1 <= k <= len(nums) * (len(nums) - 1) / 2.

```java
class Solution {
    public int smallestDistancePair(int[] nums, int k) {
        //sort the input array
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        //use binary search to find the kth distance value
        int l = 0, r = nums[nums.length - 1] - nums[0];
        while(l < r){
            int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
            if(noBigger(nums, m) >= k) r = m;
            else l = m + 1;
        }
        return l;
    }
    //the method to find out how many distances are smaller than the target value
    private int noBigger(int[] nums, int target){
        int n = nums.length;
        int count = 0;
        //use two pointer
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while(i < n - 1){
            //move the j pointer to the last position that the distance between two pointers is still no bigger than the target
            while(j < n && nums[j] - nums[i] <= target) j++;
            //accumulate total number of distances no bigger than the target
            count += j - i - 1;
            i++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(nlog(max(n, max_num)). \
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
For any given distance value, we can use O(n) two pointer DP method to compute how many actual distances are no bigger than this given value. Thus we use a binary search to find the smallest given distance value that has k distances no bigger than it. And this is the kth smallest distance value. The final time complexity is nlogn + nlog(max_num), so it comes down to which one is bigger.
