## Keyword
String, Array, HashSet

## Problem description
```
A transaction is possibly invalid if:

the amount exceeds $1000, or;
if it occurs within (and including) 60 minutes of another transaction with the same name in a different city.
Each transaction string transactions[i] consists of comma separated values representing the name, time (in minutes), amount, and city of the transaction.

Given a list of transactions, return a list of transactions that are possibly invalid.  You may return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: transactions = ["alice,20,800,mtv","alice,50,100,beijing"]
Output: ["alice,20,800,mtv","alice,50,100,beijing"]
Explanation: The first transaction is invalid because the second transaction occurs within a difference of 60 minutes, have the same name and is in a different city. Similarly the second one is invalid too.
Example 2:

Input: transactions = ["alice,20,800,mtv","alice,50,1200,mtv"]
Output: ["alice,50,1200,mtv"]
Example 3:

Input: transactions = ["alice,20,800,mtv","bob,50,1200,mtv"]
Output: ["bob,50,1200,mtv"]
 

Constraints:

transactions.length <= 1000
Each transactions[i] takes the form "{name},{time},{amount},{city}"
Each {name} and {city} consist of lowercase English letters, and have lengths between 1 and 10.
Each {time} consist of digits, and represent an integer between 0 and 1000.
Each {amount} consist of digits, and represent an integer between 0 and 2000.

```java

        int n = transactions.length;
        //record invalid transactions
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        //splits all transactions
        String[][] splited = new String[n][];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            splited[i] = transactions[i].split(",");
        }
        //compare each transaction pair
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
                String[] array1 = splited[i];
                String[] array2 = splited[j];
                //too large
                if (Integer.parseInt(array1[2]) > 1000) {
                    set.add(i);
                }
                if (Integer.parseInt(array2[2]) > 1000) {
                    set.add(j);
                }
                //if same name, less than or equal to 60 min apart and diff location, both are invalid
                if (array1[0].equals(array2[0]) && Math.abs(Integer.parseInt(array1[1]) - Integer.parseInt(array2[1])) <= 60 && !array1[3].equals(array2[3])) {
                    set.add(i);
                    set.add(j);
                }
            }
        }
        List<String> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        for (var t : set) {
            ans.add(transactions[t]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
