## Problem description
```
Given a paragraph and a list of banned words, return the most frequent word that is not in the list of banned words.  It is guaranteed there is at least one word that isn't banned, and that the answer is unique.

Words in the list of banned words are given in lowercase, and free of punctuation.  Words in the paragraph are not case sensitive.  The answer is in lowercase.

 

Example:

Input: 
paragraph = "Bob hit a ball, the hit BALL flew far after it was hit."
banned = ["hit"]
Output: "ball"
Explanation: 
"hit" occurs 3 times, but it is a banned word.
"ball" occurs twice (and no other word does), so it is the most frequent non-banned word in the paragraph. 
Note that words in the paragraph are not case sensitive,
that punctuation is ignored (even if adjacent to words, such as "ball,"), 
and that "hit" isn't the answer even though it occurs more because it is banned.
 

Note:

1 <= paragraph.length <= 1000.
0 <= banned.length <= 100.
1 <= banned[i].length <= 10.
The answer is unique, and written in lowercase (even if its occurrences in paragraph may have uppercase symbols, and even if it is a proper noun.)
paragraph only consists of letters, spaces, or the punctuation symbols !?',;.
There are no hyphens or hyphenated words.
Words only consist of letters, never apostrophes or other punctuation symbols.

## 5/15/2019 HashMap, HashSet

```java
class Solution {
    public String mostCommonWord(String paragraph, String[] banned) {
        //add a delimiter at the end to avoid corner case
        paragraph = paragraph + '.';
        //use hash set to store all banned words
        Set<String> banSet = new HashSet<>();
        for (String ban : banned){
            banSet.add(ban);
        }
        //use hashmap to keep counts of appearance of each word
        Map<String, Integer> count = new HashMap<>();
        String ans = "";
        int maxCount = 0;
        //use string builder to keep track of the current word
        StringBuilder word = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < paragraph.length(); ++i){
            char c = paragraph.charAt(i);
            //extend the current word
            if (Character.isLetter(c)){
                word.append(Character.toLowerCase(c));
            }
            //evaluate the current word
            else if (word.length() > 0){
                String curr = word.toString();
                if (!banSet.contains(curr)){
                    int currCount = count.getOrDefault(curr, 0) + 1;
                    if (currCount > maxCount){
                        maxCount = currCount;
                        ans = curr;
                    }
                    count.put(curr, currCount);
                }
                //reset the string builder
                word = new StringBuilder();
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
## Complexity Analyze
one pass + hash\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Use hash set to keep banned words and hash map to keep count of legal words. Utilize string builder to extract each word from the paragraph and evaluate them. Note we can add a delimiter to the end of the paragraph to solve corner cases.
