## Keyword
String, Sorting

## Problem description
```
You have an array of logs.  Each log is a space delimited string of words.

For each log, the first word in each log is an alphanumeric identifier.  Then, either:

Each word after the identifier will consist only of lowercase letters, or;
Each word after the identifier will consist only of digits.
We will call these two varieties of logs letter-logs and digit-logs.  It is guaranteed that each log has at least one word after its identifier.

Reorder the logs so that all of the letter-logs come before any digit-log.  The letter-logs are ordered lexicographically ignoring identifier, with the identifier used in case of ties.  The digit-logs should be put in their original order.

Return the final order of the logs.

 

Example 1:

Input: logs = ["dig1 8 1 5 1","let1 art can","dig2 3 6","let2 own kit dig","let3 art zero"]
Output: ["let1 art can","let3 art zero","let2 own kit dig","dig1 8 1 5 1","dig2 3 6"]
 

Constraints:

0 <= logs.length <= 100
3 <= logs[i].length <= 100
logs[i] is guaranteed to have an identifier, and a word after the identifier.
```

## 5/15/2019 lambda expression sort

```java
class Solution {
    public String[] reorderLogFiles(String[] logs) {
        //sort the array
        Arrays.sort(logs, (log1, log2) -> {
            //spit the identifier out
            String[] split1 = log1.split(" ", 2);
            String[] split2 = log2.split(" ", 2);
            //check the type of log
            boolean isDigit1 = Character.isDigit(split1[1].charAt(0));
            boolean isDigit2 = Character.isDigit(split2[1].charAt(0));
            //if both logs are letters
            if (!isDigit1 && !isDigit2){
                //if both log are letter logs
                int compare = split1[1].compareTo(split2[1]);
                //if the logs are identical, compare the identifier
                if (compare == 0){
                    return split1[0].compareTo(split2[0]);
                }
                return compare;
            }
            //digit log goes behind
            return isDigit1 ? (isDigit2 ? 0 : 1) : -1;
        });
        return logs;
    }
}
```
## Complexity Analyze
lambda expression sort\
Time complexity: O(AlogA) where A is the total content of of the array\
Space complexity: O(A)

## Notes
Use custom sort to sort the array. Notice how we can use lambda to simplify the code.

## Key points
Corner cases:\
API: String.split(), Character.isDidigt(), String.compareTo\
Notion: Lambda expression, ternary operator
