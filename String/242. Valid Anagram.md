## Keyword
String, Hash table

## Problem description
```
Given two strings s and t , write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s.

Example 1:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
Note:
You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.

Follow up:
What if the inputs contain unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such case?

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isAnagram(String s, String t) {
        if(s.length() != t.length())
            return false;
        if(s.isEmpty() && t.isEmpty())
            return true;
        int n = s.length();
        int[] counter = new int[26];
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            counter[s.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
            counter[t.charAt(i) - 'a']--;
        }
        for(int count : counter){
            if(count != 0)
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
one pass Hash table\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
To be anagrams is to have same numbers for each character. So the best way to find out is to count these numbers. Since input character is limited to only lowercase letters, a simple hash table implemented by array is the best for this problem. Even if the the input's charater is not limited lowercase letters there are still only 256 possible cases. Hince the same method applies.

## Key Points
Corner cases: if both strings are empty, they are still anagrams to each other\
Other: check if length of these strings are the same first
