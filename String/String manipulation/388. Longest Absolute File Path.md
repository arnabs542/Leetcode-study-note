## Problem description
```
Suppose we have the file system represented in the following picture:



We will represent the file system as a string where "\n\t" mean a subdirectory of the main directory, "\n\t\t" means a subdirectory of the subdirectory of the main directory and so on. Each folder will be represented as a string of letters and/or digits. Each file will be in the form "s1.s2" where s1 and s2 are strings of letters and/or digits.

For example, the file system above is represented as "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext".

Given a string input representing the file system in the explained format, return the length of the longest absolute path to a file in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return 0.

 

Example 1:


Input: input = "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext"
Output: 20
Explanation: We have only one file and its path is "dir/subdir2/file.ext" of length 20.
The path "dir/subdir1" doesn't contain any files.
Example 2:


Input: input = "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext"
Output: 32
Explanation: We have two files:
"dir/subdir1/file1.ext" of length 21
"dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext" of length 32.
We return 32 since it is the longest path.
Example 3:

Input: input = "a"
Output: 0
Explanation: We don't have any files.
 

Constraints:

1 <= input.length <= 104
input may contain lower-case or upper-case English letters, a new line character '\n', a tab character '\t', a dot '.', a space ' ' or digits.

## 09/23/2020 Stack + String
```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthLongestPath(String input) {
        String[] strs = input.split("\n");
        int max = 0;
        int curLen = 0;
        Stack<Integer> folder = new Stack<>();
        
        for (String s : strs) {
            String clean = s.replaceAll("\t", "");
            int level = s.length() - clean.length();
            while (folder.size() > level) {
                curLen -= folder.pop();
            }
            folder.push(clean.length());
            curLen += clean.length();
            if (s.contains(".")) {
                max = Math.max(max, level + curLen);
            }
            
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Use stack to keep different level of folder or file length. Number of char missing after replacing '\t' is the level of the current folder or file.
