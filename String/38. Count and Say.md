## Keyword
String, Recursion

## Problem description
```
The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.

Given an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

 

Example 1:

Input: 1
Output: "1"
Example 2:

Input: 4
Output: "1211"
```

```java
class Solution {
    public String countAndSay(int n) {
        if(n == 1) return "1";
        return read(countAndSay(n - 1));
    }
    private String read(String s){
        char c = s.charAt(0);
        int counter = 1;
        StringBuilder res = new StringBuilder("");
        for(int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++){
            if(s.charAt(i) != c){
                res.append(counter).append(c);
                c = s.charAt(i);
                counter = 1;
            }
            else counter++;
        }
        return res.append(counter).append(c).toString();
    }
}
```
## Complexity Analyze
Iteration\
Time complexity: O(kn) where n is total numbers of recursion call and k is the average length of the string(?)\
Space complexity: O(kn)

## Notes
Iteration or recursion is fine.

## Key points
Corner cases:\
API: StringBuilder.append(), StringBuilder.toString(). Notice that you can chain StringBuilder.append() because the method returns a reference of the StringBuilder itself\
Notion:
