## Keyword
Hash Table, Sliding Window

## Problem description
```
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:

Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
Example 2:

Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

## 2/3/2020 Sliding window(optimized)

```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        int maxLength = 0;
        int left = 0;//left most non repeating index
        Map<Character, Integer> hmp = new HashMap<>();
        //traverse the string
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
            char current = s.charAt(i);
            //when a repeat happens, update the left most index accordingly
            if(hmp.containsKey(current)){
                if(hmp.get(current) >= left){
                    left = hmp.get(current) + 1;
                }
            }
            hmp.put(current, i);
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, i - left + 1);
        }
        return maxLength;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
one pass\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(min(m,n)) We need O(k) space for the sliding window, where k is the size of the Set. The size of the Set is upper bounded by the size of the string n and the size of the charset/alphabet m.

## Notes
A sliding window is an abstract concept commonly used in array or string problems. A window is a range of elements in the array or string which usually defined by the start and end indices, i.e. [i, j)[i,j) (left-closed, right-open). A sliding window is a window "slides" its two boundaries to the certain direction. For example, if we slide [i, j)[i,j) to the right by 1 element, then it becomes [i+1, j+1)[i+1,j+1) (left-closed, right-open).
