## Problem description
```
We can represent a sentence as an array of words, for example, the sentence "I am happy with leetcode" can be represented as arr = ["I","am",happy","with","leetcode"].

Given two sentences sentence1 and sentence2 each represented as a string array and given an array of string pairs similarPairs where similarPairs[i] = [xi, yi] indicates that the two words xi and yi are similar.

Return true if sentence1 and sentence2 are similar, or false if they are not similar.

Two sentences are similar if:

They have the same length (i.e. the same number of words)
sentence1[i] and sentence2[i] are similar.
Notice that a word is always similar to itself, also notice that the similarity relation is not transitive. For example, if the words a and b are similar and the words b and c are similar, a and c are not necessarily similar.

 

Example 1:

Input: sentence1 = ["great","acting","skills"], sentence2 = ["fine","drama","talent"], similarPairs = [["great","fine"],["drama","acting"],["skills","talent"]]
Output: true
Explanation: The two sentences have the same length and each word i of sentence1 is also similar to the corresponding word in sentence2.
Example 2:

Input: sentence1 = ["great"], sentence2 = ["great"], similarPairs = []
Output: true
Explanation: A word is similar to itself.
Example 3:

Input: sentence1 = ["great"], sentence2 = ["doubleplus","good"], similarPairs = [["great","doubleplus"]]
Output: false
Explanation: As they don't have the same length, we return false.
 

Constraints:

1 <= sentence1.length, sentence2.length <= 1000
1 <= sentence1[i].length, sentence2[i].length <= 20
sentence1[i] and sentence2[i] consist of lower-case and upper-case English letters.
0 <= similarPairs.length <= 1000
similarPairs[i].length == 2
1 <= xi.length, yi.length <= 20
xi and yi consist of lower-case and upper-case English letters.
All the pairs (xi, yi) are distinct.

            return false;
        }
        
        //use hashmap to store similar pairs
        Map<String, Set<String>> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (List<String> pair : similarPairs) {
            map.computeIfAbsent(pair.get(0), x -> new HashSet<>()).add(pair.get(1));
            map.computeIfAbsent(pair.get(1), x -> new HashSet<>()).add(pair.get(0));
        }
        
        //check if two sentence1 are similar
        for (int i = 0; i < sentence1.length; ++i) {
            String word1 = sentence1[i];
            String word2 = sentence2[i];
            if (word1.equals(word2)) {
                continue;
            }
            if (!map.containsKey(word1) || !map.get(word1).contains(word2)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}

Time complexity: O(N + P)  
Space complexity: O(P)

## Notes
Use hashset to store pairs first.
