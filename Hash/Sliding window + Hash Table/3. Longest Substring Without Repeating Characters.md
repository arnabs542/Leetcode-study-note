## Keyword
Hash Table, Sliding Window

## Problem description
```
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:

Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
Example 2:

Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        //sliding window
        //use hashset to store each character that appears in the window
        Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
        int max = 0;
        for (int left = 0, right = 0; right < s.length(); ++right) {
            char c = s.charAt(right);
            while (set.contains(c)) {
                char l = s.charAt(left);
                set.remove(l);
                ++left;
            }
            set.add(c);
            max = Math.max(max, right - left + 1);
        }
        
        return max;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(min(m,n)) We need O(k) space for the sliding window, where k is the size of the Set. The size of the Set is upper bounded by the size of the string n and the size of the charset/alphabet m.

## Notes
A sliding window is an abstract concept commonly used in array or string problems. A window is a range of elements in the array or string which usually defined by the start and end indices, i.e. [i, j)[i,j) (left-closed, right-open). A sliding window is a window "slides" its two boundaries to the certain direction. For example, if we slide [i, j)[i,j) to the right by 1 element, then it becomes [i+1, j+1)[i+1,j+1) (left-closed, right-open).
