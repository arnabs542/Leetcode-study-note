## Keyword
Hash + PriorityQueue

## Problem description
```
Given a list of scores of different students, return the average score of each student's top five scores in the order of each student's id.

Each entry items[i] has items[i][0] the student's id, and items[i][1] the student's score.  The average score is calculated using integer division.

 

Example 1:

Input: [[1,91],[1,92],[2,93],[2,97],[1,60],[2,77],[1,65],[1,87],[1,100],[2,100],[2,76]]
Output: [[1,87],[2,88]]
Explanation: 
The average of the student with id = 1 is 87.
The average of the student with id = 2 is 88.6. But with integer division their average converts to 88.
 

Note:

1 <= items.length <= 1000
items[i].length == 2
The IDs of the students is between 1 to 1000
The score of the students is between 1 to 100
For each student, there are at least 5 scores

## 09/06/2020 HashMap + PriorityQueue
```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] highFive(int[][] items) {
        //sort all items using priority queue
        TreeMap<Integer, PriorityQueue<Integer>> map = new TreeMap<>();
        for (var i : items) {
            PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = map.computeIfAbsent(i[0], x -> new PriorityQueue<>());
            pq.add(i[1]);
            if (pq.size() > 5) {
                pq.poll();
            }
        }
        
        int[][] res = new int[map.size()][2];
        int index = 0;
        for (var set : map.entrySet()) {
            int key = set.getKey();
            PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = set.getValue();
            res[index][0] = key;
            int sum = 0;
            while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
                sum += pq.poll();
            }
            res[index][1] = sum / 5;
            ++index;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Use HashMap to group each student's scores and use priorityqueue to sort the scores.
