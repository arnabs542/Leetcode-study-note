## Keyword
Array, Hash set

## Problem description
```
Given an integer array arr, count how many elements x there are, such that x + 1 is also in arr.

If there're duplicates in arr, count them seperately.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: 1 and 2 are counted cause 2 and 3 are in arr.
Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7]
Output: 0
Explanation: No numbers are counted, cause there's no 2, 4, 6, or 8 in arr.
Example 3:

Input: arr = [1,3,2,3,5,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: 0, 1 and 2 are counted cause 1, 2 and 3 are in arr.
Example 4:

Input: arr = [1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
Explanation: Two 1s are counted cause 2 is in arr.
Example 5:

Input: arr = [1,1,2]
Output: 2
Explanation: Both 1s are counted because 2 is in the array.
 

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 1000
0 <= arr[i] <= 1000
```
## 4/21/2020 Hash Table

```java
class Solution {
    public int countElements(int[] arr) {
        //store all elements in hash set
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for(var i : arr){
            set.add(i);
        }
        //count x
        int ans = 0;
        Map<Integer, Integer> hmp = new HashMap<>();
        for(var i : arr){
            if(set.contains(i + 1)) ans++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Hash Table\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
We can use hash set to store all elements, then iterate through it to find how many nubmers have their x + 1 in the set too.
