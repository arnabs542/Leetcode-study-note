## Problem description
```
Some people will make friend requests. The list of their ages is given and ages[i] is the age of the ith person. 

Person A will NOT friend request person B (B != A) if any of the following conditions are true:

age[B] <= 0.5 * age[A] + 7
age[B] > age[A]
age[B] > 100 && age[A] < 100
Otherwise, A will friend request B.

Note that if A requests B, B does not necessarily request A.  Also, people will not friend request themselves.

How many total friend requests are made?

Example 1:

Input: [16,16]
Output: 2
Explanation: 2 people friend request each other.
Example 2:

Input: [16,17,18]
Output: 2
Explanation: Friend requests are made 17 -> 16, 18 -> 17.
Example 3:

Input: [20,30,100,110,120]
Output: 3
Explanation: Friend requests are made 110 -> 100, 120 -> 110, 120 -> 100.
 

Notes:

1 <= ages.length <= 20000.
1 <= ages[i] <= 120.
```

## 7/12/2020 HashMap

```java
class Solution {
    public int numFriendRequests(int[] ages) {
        //use array to record all ages and their counts
        int[] map = new int[121];
        for (int i : ages) {
            ++map[i];
        }
        //count number of possible requests for each age
        int total = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= 120; ++i) {
            if (map[i] == 0) {
                continue;
            }
            int count = map[i];
            for (int j = i / 2 + 8; j <= i; ++j) {
                if (map[j] == 0) {
                    continue;
                }
                if (j < i) { //lower age group
                    total += map[j] * count;
                } else { //same age group
                    total += count * (count - 1);
                }
            }
        }
        return total;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n + m ^ 2) n is number of people, m is number of different ages\
Space complexity: O(m)

## Notes
Since the number of ages is fairly small, we can use an array as hashmap to store all age and counts. Note if age a != b, then there will be count(a) * count(b) request made. if age a == b, there will be count(a) * (count(a) - 1) requests made.
