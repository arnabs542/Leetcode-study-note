## Keyword
Hash Set

## Problem description
```
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

Example:

Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestConsecutive(int[] nums) {
        //use hash set to record each number
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i : nums) {
            set.add(i);
        }
        //try to count each consecutive group from the lowest number
        int len = 0;
        for (Integer i : set) {
            //lowest number
            if (!set.contains(i - 1)) {
                int curLen = 1;
                int cur = i;
                while (set.contains(cur + 1)) {
                    ++cur;
                    ++curLen;
                }
                len = Math.max(len, curLen);
            }
        }
        return len;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Use hash set to store all the unique numbers. Then start from every lowest number of consecutive groups to count the length while updating the global length.
