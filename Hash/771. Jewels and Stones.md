## Keyword
Hash Set

## Problem description
```
You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:

Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
Note:

S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
The characters in J are distinct.

## 5/2/2020 Hash Set

```java
class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String J, String S) {
        //use hash set to store jewels for easy query
        Set<Character> jewels = new HashSet<>();
        for(var j : J.toCharArray()){
            jewels.add(j);
        }
        int count = 0;
        for(var s : S.toCharArray()){
            if(jewels.contains(s)){
                ++count;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Hash Set\
Time complexity: O(J + S)\
Space complexity: O(J)

## Notes
Use hash set to store all jewels for easy query when looking for jewels in stones

## Key points
Corner cases:\
API: HashSet.contains(), HashSet.add()
