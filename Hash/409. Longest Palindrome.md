## Keyword
Hash Map

## Problem description
```
Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters.

This is case sensitive, for example "Aa" is not considered a palindrome here.

Note:
Assume the length of given string will not exceed 1,010.

Example:

Input:
"abccccdd"

Output:
7

Explanation:
One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.

## 8/14/2020 Hash count

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestPalindrome(String s) {
        //use HashMap to count each letters
        Map<Character, Integer> count = new HashMap<>();
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            count.put(c, count.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        //get total number of even counts and all odd counts reduced by 1 and potentially 1 extra odd in the middle
        int total = 0;
        boolean odd = false;
        for (int c : count.values()) {
            if (c % 2 == 0) {
                total += c;
            } else {
                total += c - 1;
                odd = true;
            }
        }
        return total + (odd ? 1 : 0);
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Use hashmap to count each character, then get total number of even counts and all odd counts reduced by 1 and potentially 1 extra odd in the middle.
