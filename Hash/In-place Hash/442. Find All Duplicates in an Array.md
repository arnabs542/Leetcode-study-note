## Keyword
Hash Table, in-place hash

## Problem description
```
Given an array of integers, 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.

Find all the elements that appear twice in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime?

Example:
Input:
[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

Output:
[2,3]
```
## 6/7/2020 in-place hash

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        //create the result list
        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
        //iterate through the input array, mark visited numbers by setting the corresponding index's number to be negative.
        for (int i : nums) {
            i = Math.abs(i);
            if (nums[i - 1] < 0) { //collect elements that appear twice by checking if the index's number is negative
                list.add(i);
            } else {
                nums[i - 1] *= -1;
            }
        }
        //return the result list
        return list;
    }
}

```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity : O(n)\
Space complexity : O(1)

## Notes
Since the input range is from 1 to n, we can use the sign of number on each index as an indicator to hash appearance of each number.
