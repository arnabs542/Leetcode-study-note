## LeetCode link(Easy)
https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/

## Keyword
Linked List, cycle detection

## Problem description
```
Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

 

Example 1:

Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.


Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.


Example 3:

Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?

public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        //use two runners to find if the link list has a cycle
        ListNode fast = head, slow = head;
        while(fast != null && fast.next != null){
            fast = fast.next.next;
            slow = slow.next;
            if(fast == slow) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
fast and slow runner\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
The best way to find a cycle in a linked list is to use Floyd's tortoise and hare cycle detection method

## Key points
Corner cases: when the head is null\
