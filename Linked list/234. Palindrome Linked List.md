```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(ListNode head) {
        //corner cases
        if(head == null) return true;
        //use two pointers to find the middle of the link list
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy.next = head;
        ListNode fast = dummy, slow = dummy;
        while(fast.next != null){
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next;
            if(fast.next != null) {
                fast = fast.next;
            }
        }
        //reverse the second half of the list
        ListNode secondHalf = slow.next;
        secondHalf = reverseList(secondHalf);
        //compare the first half and the second half
        while(secondHalf != null){
            if(secondHalf.val != head.val) return false;
            secondHalf = secondHalf.next;
            head = head.next;
        }
        return true;
    }
    private ListNode reverseList(ListNode head){
        ListNode pre = null, cur = head, next = head;
        while(cur != null){
            next = cur.next;
            cur.next = pre;
            pre = cur;
            cur = next;
        }
        return pre;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Two pass\
Time complexity: O(n) \
Space complexity: O(1) 

## Notes
Use the fast and slow two runners pointer technique, we can find the mid point of the list and then reverse the second half. This combo of technique can be used on many linked list questions.

## 2/11/2020 Community recursion(advanced)

```java
class Solution {

    private ListNode frontPointer;

    private boolean recursivelyCheck(ListNode currentNode) {
        if (currentNode != null) {
            if (!recursivelyCheck(currentNode.next)) return false;
            if (currentNode.val != frontPointer.val) return false;
            frontPointer = frontPointer.next;
        }
        return true;
    }

    public boolean isPalindrome(ListNode head) {
        frontPointer = head;
        return recursivelyCheck(head);
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
recursion with outside variable\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(n))

## Notes
In an attempt to come up with a way of using O(1) space, you might have thought of using recursion. However, this is still O(n)O(n) space. Let's have a look at it and understand why it is not O(1) space.\
Recursion gives us an elegant way to iterate through the nodes in reverse. For example, this algorithm will print out the values of the nodes in reverse. Given a node, the algorithm checks if it is null. If it is null, nothing happens. Otherwise, all nodes after it are processed, and then the value for the current node is printed.\
If we iterate the nodes in reverse using recursion, and iterate forward at the same time using a variable outside the recursive function, then we can check whether or not we have a palindrome.
