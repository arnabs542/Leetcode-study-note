## 2/10/2020 priority queue

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeKLists(ListNode[] lists) {
        //decalre the priority queue with the right comparator
        PriorityQueue<ListNode> q = new PriorityQueue<>(new Comparator<ListNode>(){
            @Override
            public int compare(ListNode a, ListNode b){
                return a.val - b.val;
            }
        });
        //load the queue with every list head
        for(ListNode l : lists){
            if(l != null){
                q.add(l);
            }
        }
        //build a new list using elements in the q and refill with the used elements' next
        ListNode head = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode cur = head;
        while(!q.isEmpty()){
            cur.next = q.poll();
            if(cur.next.next != null){
                q.add(cur.next.next);
            }
            cur = cur.next;
        }
        return head.next;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
fixed size priority queue\
Time complexity: O(nlogk) Almost every element in the final list needs to do logk times of comparison while in the priority queue\
Space complexity: O(k) The priority queue takes k space

## Notes
While you are traversing the list, change the current node's next pointer to point to its previous element. Since a node does not have reference to its previous node, you must store its previous element beforehand. You also need another pointer to store the next node before changing the reference. Do not forget to return the new head reference at the end!

## Key points
Corner cases: When a list is empty\
API: PriorityQueue(Comparator<type> comparator), anonymous class expression, PriorityQueue.add(), PriorityQueue.poll(), PriorityQueue.isEmpty()

## 2/10/2020 Community merge recursion

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeKLists(ListNode[] lists) {
        if(lists == null || lists.length == 0){
            return null;
        }
        return helper(lists, 0, lists.length - 1);
    }
    //recursion helper function
    private ListNode helper(ListNode[] lists, int l, int r){
        if(l < r){
            int mid = (l + r) / 2;
            return merge2Lists(helper(lists, l, mid), helper(lists, mid + 1, r));
        }
        //l is never going to be out of boundary here
        return lists[l];
    }
    public ListNode merge2Lists(ListNode l1, ListNode l2){
        //dummy head
        ListNode head = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode cur = head;
        //compare and merge when both lists are not empty
        while(l1 != null && l2 != null){
            if(l1.val < l2.val){
                cur.next = l1;
                l1 = l1.next;
            }
            else{
                cur.next = l2;
                l2 = l2.next;
            }
            cur = cur.next;
        }
        //link whichever list that has elements left to the new list
        if(l1 != null){
            cur.next = l1;
        }
        else{
            cur.next = l2;
        }
        return head.next;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
merge recursion\
Time complexity: O(nlogk) same with merge sort\
Space complexity: O(k))

## Notes
The recursive version is slightly trickier and the key is to work backwards. Assume that the rest of the list had already been reversed, now how do I reverse the front part? Let's assume the list is: n1 → … → nk-1 → nk → nk+1 → … → nm → Ø

Assume from node nk+1 to nm had been reversed and you are at node nk.

n1 → … → nk-1 → nk → nk+1 ← … ← nm

We want nk+1’s next node to point to nk.

So,

nk.next.next = nk;

Be very careful that n1's next must point to Ø. If you forget about this, your linked list has a cycle in it. This bug could be caught if you test your code with a linked list of size 2.
