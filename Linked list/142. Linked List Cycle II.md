https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/

## Keyword
Linked List

## Problem description
```
Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

Note: Do not modify the linked list.

 

Example 1:

Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.


Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.


Example 3:

Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

## Complexity Analyze
two pass\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
The best way to find a cycle and the cycle start point in a linked list is to use Floyd's tortoise and hare cycle detection method

## Key points
