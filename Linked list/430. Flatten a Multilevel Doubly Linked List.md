## Keyword
Linked List

## Problem description
```
You are given a doubly linked list which in addition to the next and previous pointers, it could have a child pointer, which may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure, as shown in the example below.

Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. You are given the head of the first level of the list.

 

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]
Output: [1,2,3,7,8,11,12,9,10,4,5,6]
Explanation:

The multilevel linked list in the input is as follows:



After flattening the multilevel linked list it becomes:


Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2,null,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
Explanation:

The input multilevel linked list is as follows:

  1---2---NULL
  |
  3---NULL
Example 3:

Input: head = []
Output: []
 

How multilevel linked list is represented in test case:

We use the multilevel linked list from Example 1 above:

 1---2---3---4---5---6--NULL
         |
         7---8---9---10--NULL
             |
             11--12--NULL
The serialization of each level is as follows:

[1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
[7,8,9,10,null]
[11,12,null]
To serialize all levels together we will add nulls in each level to signify no node connects to the upper node of the previous level. The serialization becomes:

[1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
[null,null,7,8,9,10,null]
[null,11,12,null]
Merging the serialization of each level and removing trailing nulls we obtain:

[1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]
 

Constraints:

Number of Nodes will not exceed 1000.
1 <= Node.val <= 10^5
```
## 7/10/2020 Recursion

```java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node prev;
    public Node next;
    public Node child;
};
*/

class Solution {
    public Node flatten(Node head) {
        //use recursion to flatten the list
        flat(head);
        return head;
    }
    private Node flat(Node head) {
        Node cur = head;
        Node prev = null;
        //iterate through the list
        while (cur != null) {
            Node next = cur.next;
            //for any node that has a child list, flatten the child list and connect everything together
            if (cur.child != null) {
                Node tail = flat(cur.child);
                cur.next = cur.child;
                cur.next.prev = cur;
                //clear the child pointer
                cur.child = null;
                if (next != null) {
                    tail.next = next;
                    next.prev = tail;
                }
            }
            prev = cur;
            cur = next;
        }
        //return the tail of the list
        return prev;
    }
}
```

## 7/10/2020 Stack, reconnect each

```java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node prev;
    public Node next;
    public Node child;

    public Node() {}

    public Node(int _val,Node _prev,Node _next,Node _child) {
        val = _val;
        prev = _prev;
        next = _next;
        child = _child;
    }
};
*/
class Solution {
  public Node flatten(Node head) {
    if (head == null) return head;

    Node pseudoHead = new Node(0, null, head, null);
    Node curr, prev = pseudoHead;

    Deque<Node> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
    stack.push(head);

    while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
      curr = stack.pop();
      prev.next = curr;
      curr.prev = prev;

      if (curr.next != null) stack.push(curr.next);
      if (curr.child != null) {
        stack.push(curr.child);
        // don't forget to remove all child pointers.
        curr.child = null;
      }
      prev = curr;
    }
    // detach the pseudo node from the result
    pseudoHead.next.prev = null;
    return pseudoHead.next;
  }
}
```

Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Utilize stack to iterate through the entire list with the correct order and reconnect each two nodes.
