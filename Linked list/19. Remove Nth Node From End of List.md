## Keyword
Linked List

## Problem description
```
Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.

Example:

Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
Note:

Given n will always be valid.

Could you do this in one pass?

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
        //create a dummy for the slow pointer to avoid the corner case
        ListNode fast = head, slow, dummy = new ListNode(0);
        slow = dummy;
        dummy.next = head;
        //let fast pointer go first
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            fast = fast.next;
        }
        //traverse through the list
        while(fast != null){
            fast = fast.next;
            slow = slow.next;
        }
        //remove the node
        slow.next = slow.next.next;
        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
one pass\
Time complexity: O(L) where L is the length of the list\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
The first pointer advances the list by n+1n+1 steps from the beginning, while the second pointer starts from the beginning of the list. Now, both pointers are exactly separated by nn nodes apart. We maintain this constant gap by advancing both pointers together until the first pointer arrives past the last node. The second pointer will be pointing at the nnth node counting from the last. We relink the next pointer of the node referenced by the second pointer to point to the node's next next node.
