## Keyword
Linked List

## Problem description
```
Reverse a singly linked list.

Example:

Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
Output: 5->4->3->2->1->NULL
Follow up:

A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

## 2/7/2020 iteration, three pointers

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        ListNode last = null, current = head, next = null;
        //iteration
        while(current != null){
            next = current.next;
            current.next = last;
            last = current;
            current = next;
        }
        return last;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(1))

## Notes
While you are traversing the list, change the current node's next pointer to point to its previous element. Since a node does not have reference to its previous node, you must store its previous element beforehand. You also need another pointer to store the next node before changing the reference. Do not forget to return the new head reference at the end!

## 2/7/2020 recursion

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        //The head is null when the linked list is empty
        if(head == null || head.next == null){
            return head;
        }
        ListNode p = reverseList(head.next);
        head.next.next = head;
        head.next = null;
        return p;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(n))

## Notes
The recursive version is slightly trickier and the key is to work backwards. Assume that the rest of the list had already been reversed, now how do I reverse the front part? Let's assume the list is: n1 → … → nk-1 → nk → nk+1 → … → nm → Ø\

Assume from node nk+1 to nm had been reversed and you are at node nk.\

n1 → … → nk-1 → nk → nk+1 ← … ← nm\

We want nk+1’s next node to point to nk. So, nk.next.next = nk;\
Be very careful that n1's next must point to Ø. If you forget about this, your linked list has a cycle in it. This bug could be caught if you test your code with a linked list of size 2.
