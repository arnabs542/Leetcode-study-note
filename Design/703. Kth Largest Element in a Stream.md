## Keyword
Design, Priority Queue

## Problem description
```
Design a class to find the kth largest element in a stream. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Your KthLargest class will have a constructor which accepts an integer k and an integer array nums, which contains initial elements from the stream. For each call to the method KthLargest.add, return the element representing the kth largest element in the stream.

Example:

int k = 3;
int[] arr = [4,5,8,2];
KthLargest kthLargest = new KthLargest(3, arr);
kthLargest.add(3);   // returns 4
kthLargest.add(5);   // returns 5
kthLargest.add(10);  // returns 5
kthLargest.add(9);   // returns 8
kthLargest.add(4);   // returns 8
Note:
You may assume that nums' length ≥ k-1 and k ≥ 1.
```

## 7/26/2020 heap
```java
class KthLargest {

    PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap;
    int k;
    
    public KthLargest(int k, int[] nums) {
        this.k = k;
        minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();
        //add all original numbers into min heap first
        for (var i : nums) {
            minHeap.add(i);
        }
        //make sure min heap only has at most k elements
        while (minHeap.size() > k) {
            minHeap.poll();
        }
    }
    
    public int add(int val) {
        //add the new number to min heap first
        minHeap.add(val);
        //move extra numbers to max heap
        while (minHeap.size() > k) {
            minHeap.poll();
        }
        return minHeap.peek();
    }
}

/**
 * Your KthLargest object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * KthLargest obj = new KthLargest(k, nums);
 * int param_1 = obj.add(val);
 */
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(logn) for add operation\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Use a heap to keep the largest k numbers.
