## Problem description
```
In an election, the i-th vote was cast for persons[i] at time times[i].

Now, we would like to implement the following query function: TopVotedCandidate.q(int t) will return the number of the person that was leading the election at time t.  

Votes cast at time t will count towards our query.  In the case of a tie, the most recent vote (among tied candidates) wins.

 

Example 1:

Input: ["TopVotedCandidate","q","q","q","q","q","q"], [[[0,1,1,0,0,1,0],[0,5,10,15,20,25,30]],[3],[12],[25],[15],[24],[8]]
Output: [null,0,1,1,0,0,1]
Explanation: 
At time 3, the votes are [0], and 0 is leading.
At time 12, the votes are [0,1,1], and 1 is leading.
At time 25, the votes are [0,1,1,0,0,1], and 1 is leading (as ties go to the most recent vote.)
This continues for 3 more queries at time 15, 24, and 8.
 

Note:

1 <= persons.length = times.length <= 5000
0 <= persons[i] <= persons.length
times is a strictly increasing array with all elements in [0, 10^9].
TopVotedCandidate.q is called at most 10000 times per test case.
TopVotedCandidate.q(int t) is always called with t >= times[0].

## 8/3/2020 Binary search
```java
class TopVotedCandidate {
    
    int[] winners;
    int[] times;
    
    public TopVotedCandidate(int[] persons, int[] times) {
        //compute winner at each time stamp
        winners = new int[persons.length];
        int maxVote = 0;
        int winner = -1;
        Map<Integer, Integer> count = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < persons.length; ++i) {
            count.put(persons[i], count.getOrDefault(persons[i], 0) + 1);
            if (count.get(persons[i]) >= maxVote) {
                maxVote = count.get(persons[i]);
                winner = persons[i];
            }
            winners[i] = winner;
        }
        this.times = times;
    }
    
    public int q(int t) {
        //use binary search to find the corresponding winner
        int l = 0;
        int r = times.length;
        while (l < r) {
            int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
            if (times[m] > t) {
                r = m;
            } else {
                l = m + 1;
            }
        }
        return winners[l - 1];
    }
}

/**
 * Your TopVotedCandidate object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * TopVotedCandidate obj = new TopVotedCandidate(persons, times);
 * int param_1 = obj.q(t);
 */
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(logn) for query\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Precompute the result of winner in each time frame, then use binary search to find the winner for each query.
