## Problem description
```
Implement FreqStack, a class which simulates the operation of a stack-like data structure.

FreqStack has two functions:

push(int x), which pushes an integer x onto the stack.
pop(), which removes and returns the most frequent element in the stack.
If there is a tie for most frequent element, the element closest to the top of the stack is removed and returned.
 

Example 1:

Input: 
["FreqStack","push","push","push","push","push","push","pop","pop","pop","pop"],
[[],[5],[7],[5],[7],[4],[5],[],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,null,null,null,null,null,null,5,7,5,4]
Explanation:
After making six .push operations, the stack is [5,7,5,7,4,5] from bottom to top.  Then:

pop() -> returns 5, as 5 is the most frequent.
The stack becomes [5,7,5,7,4].

pop() -> returns 7, as 5 and 7 is the most frequent, but 7 is closest to the top.
The stack becomes [5,7,5,4].

pop() -> returns 5.
The stack becomes [5,7,4].

pop() -> returns 4.
The stack becomes [5,7].
 

Note:

Calls to FreqStack.push(int x) will be such that 0 <= x <= 10^9.
It is guaranteed that FreqStack.pop() won't be called if the stack has zero elements.
The total number of FreqStack.push calls will not exceed 10000 in a single test case.
The total number of FreqStack.pop calls will not exceed 10000 in a single test case.
The total number of FreqStack.push and FreqStack.pop calls will not exceed 150000 across all test cases.

## 7/6/2020 Two HashMap
```java
class FreqStack {
     Map<Integer, Stack<Integer>> freqGroup;
     Map<Integer, Integer> freq;
     int highFreq;
    public FreqStack() {
        //use one hashmap to record each number's frequency and another one to record each frequency's number
        freqGroup = new HashMap<>();
        freq = new HashMap<>();
        //running highest frequency
        highFreq = 0;
    }

    public void push(int x) {
        //update frequency and frequency group
        freq.put(x, freq.getOrDefault(x, 0) + 1);
        freqGroup.computeIfAbsent(freq.get(x), y -> new Stack<>()).push(x);
        //potentially update the highest frequency
        highFreq = Math.max(highFreq, freq.get(x));
    }

    public int pop() {
        //remove the element from the frequency group
        Stack<Integer> cur = freqGroup.get(highFreq);
        int ans = cur.pop();
        freq.put(ans, freq.get(ans) - 1);
        //potentially update the highest frequency
        if (cur.isEmpty()) {
            freqGroup.remove(highFreq);
            --highFreq;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

/**
 * Your FreqStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * FreqStack obj = new FreqStack();
 * obj.push(x);
 * int param_2 = obj.pop();
 */
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(1) for push and pop\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
We can use one hashmap to record each number's frequency and another one to record each frequency's number. The key point here is that we don't need to remove the number from the original frequency group when updating it to the higher frequency group because pop() only pop the element in the highest frequency group so there won't be any conflict when calling pop(). Also, after pop(), the popped elemnt's lower frequency position is still saved in the lower frequency group.
