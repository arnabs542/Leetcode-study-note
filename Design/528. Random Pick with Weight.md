## Keyword
Design, HashMap

## Problem description
```
Given an array w of positive integers, where w[i] describes the weight of index i, write a function pickIndex which randomly picks an index in proportion to its weight.

Note:

1 <= w.length <= 10000
1 <= w[i] <= 10^5
pickIndex will be called at most 10000 times.
Example 1:

Input: 
["Solution","pickIndex"]
[[[1]],[]]
Output: [null,0]
Example 2:

Input: 
["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,0,1,1,1,0]
Explanation of Input Syntax:

The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. Solution's constructor has one argument, the array w. pickIndex has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.

    public Solution(int[] w) {
        rand = new Random();
        //create upper range bound for each number
        range = new int[w.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < w.length; ++i) {
            if (i == 0) {
                range[i] = w[i];
            } else {
                range[i] = range[i - 1] + w[i];
            }
        }
        max = range[range.length - 1];
    }
    
    public int pickIndex() {
        int mi = this.max;
        int[] test = this.range;
        //generate a random number in range
        int num = rand.nextInt(max) + 1;
        //use binary search to find the corresponding index
        int l = 0;
        int r = range.length - 1;
        while (l < r) {
            int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
            if (range[m] >= num) {
                r = m;
            } else {
                l = m + 1;
            }
        }
        return l;
    }

## Complexity Analyze
Binary Saerch\
Time complexity: O(n) for initialization; O(logn) for query\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
give each number a range using prefix sum, then use binary search to pick random number.

## Key points
Corner cases: \
API: Random().nextInt()
