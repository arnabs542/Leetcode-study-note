## Problem description
```
Given two 1d vectors, implement an iterator to return their elements alternately.

 

Example:

Input:
v1 = [1,2]
v2 = [3,4,5,6] 
Output: [1,3,2,4,5,6]
Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,3,2,4,5,6].
 

Follow up:

What if you are given k 1d vectors? How well can your code be extended to such cases?

Clarification for the follow up question:
The "Zigzag" order is not clearly defined and is ambiguous for k > 2 cases. If "Zigzag" does not look right to you, replace "Zigzag" with "Cyclic". For example:

Input:
[1,2,3]
[4,5,6,7]
[8,9]

Output: [1,4,8,2,5,9,3,6,7].
```

## 6/10/2020 iterator + queue
```java
public class ZigzagIterator {
    LinkedList<Iterator> list;
    public ZigzagIterator(List<Integer> v1, List<Integer> v2) {
        //use a linked list to store iterators of each list
        list = new LinkedList<Iterator>();
        //only add list that are not empty
        if(!v1.isEmpty()) list.add(v1.iterator());
        if(!v2.isEmpty()) list.add(v2.iterator());
    }

    public int next() {
        //retreive a number from the top iterator
        Iterator poll = list.remove();
        int result = (Integer)poll.next();
        if(poll.hasNext()) list.add(poll);
        return result;
    }

    public boolean hasNext() {
        //check if the list is empty
        return !list.isEmpty();
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
We can utilize queue(linkedlist) to iterate through all the list we have. And use iterator to iterate through each of the list. This can easily be expanded to solve k input follow-ups.
