## LeetCode link(Hard)
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/

## Keyword
Design, Priority Queue

## Problem description
```
Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value. So the median is the mean of the two middle value.

For example,
[2,3,4], the median is 3

[2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5

Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:

void addNum(int num) - Add a integer number from the data stream to the data structure.
double findMedian() - Return the median of all elements so far.
 

Example:

addNum(1)
addNum(2)
findMedian() -> 1.5
addNum(3) 
findMedian() -> 2
 

Follow up:

If all integer numbers from the stream are between 0 and 100, how would you optimize it?
If 99% of all integer numbers from the stream are between 0 and 100, how would you optimize it?
```

## 5/30/2020 Two heap
```java
class MedianFinder {
    PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap;
    PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap;
    /** initialize your data structure here. */
    public MedianFinder() {
        //use max heap and min heap to store half of the elements each
        maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((num1, num2) -> num2 - num1);
        minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();
    }
    
    public void addNum(int num) {
        //always add to max heap first
        maxHeap.add(num);
        //move 1 number to min heap
        minHeap.add(maxHeap.poll());
        //balance the size if needed
        if (maxHeap.size() < minHeap.size()) {
            maxHeap.add(minHeap.poll());
        }
    }
    
    public double findMedian() {
        int total = maxHeap.size() + minHeap.size();
        //even number of elements
        if (total % 2 == 0) {
            return ((double)maxHeap.peek() + (double)minHeap.peek()) / 2;
        } else { // odd number of elements
            return maxHeap.peek();
        }
    }
}

/**
 * Your MedianFinder object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MedianFinder obj = new MedianFinder();
 * obj.addNum(num);
 * double param_2 = obj.findMedian();
 */
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(logn) for insertion\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
We can keep two heaps for the lower and hight half of the elements. Then the median number can easily be calulated if we peek the first element in each heap.
