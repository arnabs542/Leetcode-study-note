## Keyword
Design, HashMap

## Problem description
```
Design a class which receives a list of words in the constructor, and implements a method that takes two words word1 and word2 and return the shortest distance between these two words in the list. Your method will be called repeatedly many times with different parameters. 

Example:
Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].

Input: word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”
Output: 3
Input: word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"
Output: 1
Note:
You may assume that word1 does not equal to word2, and word1 and word2 are both in the list.
```

## 7/2/2020 HashMap
```java
class WordDistance {
    Map<String, List<Integer>> map;
    public WordDistance(String[] words) {
        //use hash map store each words index
        map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < words.length; ++i) {
            map.computeIfAbsent(words[i], x -> new ArrayList<>()).add(i);
        }
    }
    
    public int shortest(String word1, String word2) {
        //query and find the shortes distance of two strings
        List<Integer> list1 = map.get(word1);
        List<Integer> list2 = map.get(word2);
        int p1 = 0;
        int p2 = 0;
        int dis = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        while (p1 < list1.size() && p2 < list2.size()) {
            int index1 = list1.get(p1);
            int index2 = list2.get(p2);
            dis = Math.min(dis, Math.abs(index1 - index2));
            if (index1 > index2) {
                ++p2;
            } else {
                ++p1;
            }
        }
        return dis;
    }
}

/**
 * Your WordDistance object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * WordDistance obj = new WordDistance(words);
 * int param_1 = obj.shortest(word1,word2);
 */
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n) for initialization and query\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Use hashmap to store each word's index, and for the query we can use two pointers to find the shortest distance. Note we cache result for each query so the next time same query will only cost O(1). Also, we could preprocess the entire list so all future query costs O(1).
