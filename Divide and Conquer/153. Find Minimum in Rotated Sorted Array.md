https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/

## Keyword
Binary search

## Problem description
```
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Example 1:

Input: [3,4,5,1,2] 
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        //when the input is empty
        if(n == 0) return -1;
        int l = 0, r = n - 1;
        while(l < r){
            int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
            //if the m is at the left of the rotation point
            if(nums[m] > nums[n - 1]) l = m + 1;
            else r = m;
        }
        //post processing
        return nums[l];
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
binary search\
Time complexity: O(logn)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Simple binary search, we can take advantage of the fact that the smallest number is always smaller or equal the right most number

## 4/11/2020 Divide and conquer

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
        return divide(nums, 0, nums.length - 1);
    }
    private int divide(int[] nums, int l, int r){
        //only 1 number left
        if(l == r) return nums[l];
        
        //if the segment is sorted
        if(nums[l] < nums[r]) return nums[l];
        
        //if the segment is not sorted, call recursion
        int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
        return Math.min(divide(nums, l, m), divide(nums, m + 1, r));
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
divide and conquer\
Time complexity: O(logn)\
Space complexity: O(logn)

## Notes
Use divide and conquer to find the minimum in the array. If the segment is sorted we know the left number is the smallest.
