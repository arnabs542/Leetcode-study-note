## Keyword
BST, Divide and Conquer

## Problem description
```
Given an integer n, generate all structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1 ... n.

Example:

Input: 3
Output:
[
  [1,null,3,2],
  [3,2,null,1],
  [3,1,null,null,2],
  [2,1,3],
  [1,null,2,null,3]
]
Explanation:
The above output corresponds to the 5 unique BST's shown below:

   1         3     3      2      1
    \       /     /      / \      \
     3     2     1      1   3      2
    /     /       \                 \
   2     1         2                 3
```

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public List<TreeNode> generateTrees(int n) {
        //if there's no valid BST
        if(n < 1) return new ArrayList<>();
        //use recursion to generate all BST
        List<TreeNode> list = buildTree(1, n);
        return list;
    }
    private List<TreeNode> buildTree(int l, int r){
        List<TreeNode> curList = new ArrayList<>();
        //when the range is not valid
        if(l > r){
            curList.add(null);
        }
        //pick a root node
        for(int i = l; i <= r; ++i){
            //compute all possible left and right subtrees
            List<TreeNode> leftTree = buildTree(l, i - 1);
            List<TreeNode> rightTree = buildTree(i + 1, r);
            //connect the current root to all subtrees
            for(var left : leftTree){
                for(var right : rightTree){
                    TreeNode root = new TreeNode(i);
                    root.left = left;
                    root.right = right;
                    curList.add(root);
                }
            }
        }
        return curList;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Recursion\
Time complexity: The main computations are to construct all possible trees with a given root, that is actually Catalan number Gn as was discussed above. This is done n times, that results in time complexity nGn. Catalan numbers grow as \frac{4^n}{n^{3/2}} that gives the final complexity \mathcal{O}(\frac{4^n}{n^{1/2}}). Seems to be large but let's not forget that here we're asked to generate G_n \sim \frac{4^n}{n^{3/2}} tree objects as output \
Space complexity: nG as we keep nGn trees with n elements each, that results in \mathcal{O}(\frac{4^n}{n^{1/2}}) complexity.

## Notes
To generate all possible BSTs, we can use recursion to generate all possible subtress and return the list to the current node as the root. The final list will contain all possible BSTs. Note that we have to add null to the list then the range is not valid.
