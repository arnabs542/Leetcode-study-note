## Keyword
Bit manipulation

## Problem description
```
The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

Note:
0 ≤ x, y < 231.

Example:

Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.

```java
class Solution {
    public int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        //get xor
        int xor = x ^ y;
        int count = 0;
        //count number of 1 bit in xor
        while (xor != 0) {
            if ((xor & 1) == 1) {
                ++count;
            }
            xor >>= 1;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(1)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
We just need to count 1 bits in the xor result of two numbers.

}
```

Time complexity: O(1)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Instead of counting bit by bit, we only need to count the right most 1 each time.
