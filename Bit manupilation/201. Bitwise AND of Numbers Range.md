## Keyword
Bit manipulation

## Problem description
```
Given a range [m, n] where 0 <= m <= n <= 2147483647, return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.

Example 1:

Input: [5,7]
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: [0,1]
Output: 0
```
## 4/23/2020 common prefix

```java
class Solution {
    public int rangeBitwiseAnd(int m, int n) {
        //find the common prefix of two range number
        int shift = 0;
        while(m < n){
            //shift m and n to right 1 digit a time until m equals n
            m >>= 1;
            n >>= 1;
            shift++;
        }
        //return the common prefix
        return m << shift;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
common prefix\
Time complexity: O(1)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
The key of this problem is to find the common prefix of the start and the end of the range for it will be the bitwise and result. To do so, we can shift 1 bit a time to the right for both numbers until they equal.

## 4/23/2020 common prefix + Brian Kernighan's Algorithm

```java
class Solution {
  public int rangeBitwiseAnd(int m, int n) {
    while (m < n) {
      // turn off rightmost 1-bit
      n = n & (n - 1);
    }
    return n;
  }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Brian Kernighan's Algorithm\
Time complexity: O(1)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
To find the common prefix, we can also use Brian Kernighan's Algorithm to turn off 1 rightmost 1 digit a time of the upper bound until it is equal or smaller than the lower bound and it will be the common prefix of two bounds.
