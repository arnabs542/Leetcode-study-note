## Keyword
Bit manipulation, Math

## Problem description
```
Given a non-negative integer num, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero. If the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2, otherwise, you have to subtract 1 from it.

 

Example 1:

Input: num = 14
Output: 6
Explanation: 
Step 1) 14 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 7. 
Step 2) 7 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 6.
Step 3) 6 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 3. 
Step 4) 3 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 2. 
Step 5) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1. 
Step 6) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.
Example 2:

Input: num = 8
Output: 4
Explanation: 
Step 1) 8 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 4. 
Step 2) 4 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 2. 
Step 3) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1. 
Step 4) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.
Example 3:

Input: num = 123
Output: 12
 

Constraints:

0 <= num <= 10^6

        int step = 0;
        while (num > 0) {
            if (num % 2 == 1) {
                ++step;
                --num;
            } else {
                ++step;
                num /= 2;
            }
        }
        return step;
    }
}

## 8/18/2020 Count bits

```java
public int numberOfSteps(int num) {
    
    // Get the binary for num, as a String.
    String binaryString = Integer.toBinaryString(num);
    
    int steps = 0;
    // Iterate over all the bits in the binary string.
    for (char bit : binaryString.toCharArray()) {
        if (bit == '1') { // If the bit is a 1 
            steps = steps + 2; // Then it'll take 2 to remove.
        } else { // bit == '0'
            steps = steps + 1; // Then it'll take 1 to remove.
        }
    }

    // We need to subtract 1, because the last bit was over-counted.
    return steps - 1;
}
```
