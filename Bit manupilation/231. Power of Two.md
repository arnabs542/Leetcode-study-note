## Problem description
```
Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of two.

Example 1:

Input: 1
Output: true 
Explanation: 20 = 1
Example 2:

Input: 16
Output: true
Explanation: 24 = 16
Example 3:

Input: 218
Output: false

## 6/8/2020 get rightmost bit

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        //corner case
        if (n == 0) {
            return false;
        }
        //use long to avoid Integer.MIN_VALUE corner case
        long x = (long)n;
        //get the rightmost bit
        return x == (x & (-x));
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
get rightmost bit\
Time complexity: O(1)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Use x & (-x) to get the rightmost bit of the number, then check if it is equal to the number itself because power of 2 should only have 1 '1' bit. Note 0 and Integer.MIN_VALUE are two corner cases we have to deal with separately.

## 6/8/2020 turn off rightmost bit

```java
class Solution {
  public boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
      //corner case
      if (n == 0) {
          return false;
      }
      //use long to avoid Integer.MIN_VALUE corner case
      long x = (long) n;
      //turn off the rightmost bit
      return (x & (x - 1)) == 0;
  }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
turn off rightmost bit\
Time complexity: O(1)\

## Notes
Use x & (x - 1) to turn off the rightmost bit, then check if it is equal to 0 because power of 2 should only have 1 '1' bit. Note 0 and Integer.MIN_VALUE are two corner cases we have to deal with separately.
