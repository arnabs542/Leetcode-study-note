## Keyword
Hash Table, Bit Manipulation

## Problem description
```
Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.

Example:

Input:  [1,2,1,3,2,5]
Output: [3,5]
Note:

The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, [5, 3] is also correct.
Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int[] res = new int[2];
        int index = 0;
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (var i : nums) {
            if (set.contains(i)) {
                set.remove(i);
            } else {
               set.add(i); 
            }
        }
        for (var i : set) {
            res[index++] = i;
        }
        return res;
    }
}

## Notes
Simple hashset solution. Check which elements only appears once.

## 7/23/2020 XOR and bitmask

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        //find different bits between x and y
        int diff = 0;
        for (var i : nums) {
            diff ^= i;
        }
        //get rightmost bit of diff and assume it is in x
        int rightmost = diff & (-diff);
        //xor all elements that contains rightmost bit to find x
        int x = 0;
        for (var i : nums) {
            if ((i & rightmost) != 0) {
                x ^= i;
            }
        }
        //get y
        int y = diff ^ x;
        return new int[] {x, y};
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
XOR all elemnts to find the different bits of x and y. Then acquire the rightmost bit r and assume this bit appears only in x not y. XOR all elemnts that contains bit r, which includes x not y and we will get x. Then y is acquired by using the diferent bits to XOR x.
