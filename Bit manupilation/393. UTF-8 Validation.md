Bit manipulation, Array

## Problem description
```
A character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long, subjected to the following rules:

For 1-byte character, the first bit is a 0, followed by its unicode code.
For n-bytes character, the first n-bits are all one's, the n+1 bit is 0, followed by n-1 bytes with most significant 2 bits being 10.
This is how the UTF-8 encoding would work:

   Char. number range  |        UTF-8 octet sequence
      (hexadecimal)    |              (binary)
   --------------------+---------------------------------------------
   0000 0000-0000 007F | 0xxxxxxx
   0000 0080-0000 07FF | 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
   0000 0800-0000 FFFF | 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
   0001 0000-0010 FFFF | 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
Given an array of integers representing the data, return whether it is a valid utf-8 encoding.

Note:
The input is an array of integers. Only the least significant 8 bits of each integer is used to store the data. This means each integer represents only 1 byte of data.

Example 1:

data = [197, 130, 1], which represents the octet sequence: 11000101 10000010 00000001.

Return true.
It is a valid utf-8 encoding for a 2-bytes character followed by a 1-byte character.
Example 2:

data = [235, 140, 4], which represented the octet sequence: 11101011 10001100 00000100.

Return false.
The first 3 bits are all one's and the 4th bit is 0 means it is a 3-bytes character.
The next byte is a continuation byte which starts with 10 and that's correct.
But the second continuation byte does not start with 10, so it is invalid.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean validUtf8(int[] data) {
        for (int i = 0; i < data.length;) {
            int cur = checkCode(data, i);
            if (cur == -1) {
                return false;
            }
            i += cur;
        }
        return true;
    }

    private int checkCode(int[] data, int index) {
        int head = data[index];
        int checkBit = 1 << 7;
        int codeLength = 0;
        // find code byte length
        if ((head & checkBit) == 0) {
            return 1;
        } else if ((head & (checkBit >> 1)) == 0) {
            return -1;
        } else if ((head & (checkBit >> 2)) == 0) {
            codeLength = 2;
        } else if ((head & (checkBit >> 3)) == 0) {
            codeLength = 3;
        } else if ((head & (checkBit >> 4)) == 0) {
            codeLength = 4;
        } else {
            return -1;
        }
        // check trailing bytes
        for (int i = index + 1; i < index + codeLength; ++i) {
            // if out of bound
            if (i >= data.length) {
                return -1;
            }
            //validate the trailing bytes
            int curByte = data[i];
            if ((checkBit & curByte) == 0 || ((checkBit >> 1) & curByte) != 0) {
                return -1;
            }
        }
        return codeLength;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Check current byte to determine the code group length, then valide the group and move on to the next.
