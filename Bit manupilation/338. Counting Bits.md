Bit manipulation

## Problem description
```
Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.

Example 1:

Input: 2
Output: [0,1,1]
Example 2:

Input: 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
Follow up:

It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time O(n*sizeof(integer)). But can you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a single pass?
Space complexity should be O(n).
Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like __builtin_popcount in c++ or in any other language.

## 5/28/2020 DP + Most Significant bit

```java
public class Solution {
    public int[] countBits(int num) {
        int[] ans = new int[num + 1];
        int i = 0, b = 1;
        // [0, b) is calculated
        while (b <= num) {
            // generate [b, 2b) or [b, num) from [0, b)
            while(i < b && i + b <= num){
                ans[i + b] = ans[i] + 1;
                ++i;
            }
            i = 0;   // reset i
            b <<= 1; // b = 2b
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
most significant bit\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
The most significant bit plus the rest gives the transition function: P(x + b) = P(x) + 1 where b = 2^m > x

## Key points
Corner cases: number 0 needs to be manully put in\

## 5/28/2020 DP + Least Significant Bit

```java
public class Solution {
  public int[] countBits(int num) {
      int[] ans = new int[num + 1];
      for (int i = 1; i <= num; ++i)
        ans[i] = ans[i >> 1] + (i & 1); // x / 2 is x >> 1 and x % 2 is x & 1
      return ans;
  }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Least Significant Bit\
Time complexity: O(n)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Similar to the last solution, we can find the transition function: P(x) = P(x / 2) + (x % 2)
