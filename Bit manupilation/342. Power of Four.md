https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-four/

## Keyword
Bit manipulation, Math

## Problem description
```
Given an integer (signed 32 bits), write a function to check whether it is a power of 4.

Example 1:

Input: 16
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: 5
Output: false
Follow up: Could you solve it without loops/recursion?
```
## 8/4/2020 Bit manipulation

```java
class Solution {
  public boolean isPowerOfFour(int num) {
    return (num > 0) && ((num & (num - 1)) == 0) && ((num & 0xaaaaaaaa) == 0);
  }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(1)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
The number needs to be positive and it needs to be power of two and it's only 1 bit needs to be on even positions.

## 8/4/2020 Math

```java
class Solution {
  public boolean isPowerOfFour(int num) {
    return (num > 0) && (Math.log(num) / Math.log(2) % 2 == 0);
  }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
Time complexity: O(1)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
log(2)(num) needs to be even.
