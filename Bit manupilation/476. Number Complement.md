## Keyword
Bit manipulation

## Problem description
```
Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

 

Example 1:

Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
 

Example 2:

Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
 

Note:

The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
This question is the same as 1009: https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/

## 5/4/2020 flip bit by bit

```java
class Solution {
  public int findComplement(int num) {
    int todo = num, bit = 1;
    while (todo != 0) {
      // flip current bit
      num = num ^ bit;
      // prepare for the next run
      bit = bit << 1;
      todo = todo >> 1;
    }
    return num;
  }
}
```

  public int findComplement(int num) {
    // n is a length of num in binary representation
    int n = (int)( Math.log(num) / Math.log(2) ) + 1;
    // bitmask has the same length as num and contains only ones 1...1
    int bitmask = (1 << n) - 1;
    // flip all bits
